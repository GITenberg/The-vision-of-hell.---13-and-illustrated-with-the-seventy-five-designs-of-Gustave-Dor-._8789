<h2>CANTO XXIX</h2>
<br>

<p>SO were mine eyes inebriate with view<br>
Of the vast multitude, whom various wounds<br>
Disfigur'd, that they long'd to stay and weep.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/29-269.jpg"><img alt="29-269b.jpg (47K)" src="images/29-269b.jpg" height="548" width="352"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>But Virgil rous'd me: "What yet gazest on?<br>
Wherefore doth fasten yet thy sight below<br>
Among the maim'd and miserable shades?<br>
Thou hast not shewn in any chasm beside<br>
This weakness. &nbsp;Know, if thou wouldst number them<br>
That two and twenty miles the valley winds<br>
Its circuit, and already is the moon<br>
Beneath our feet: the time permitted now<br>
Is short, and more not seen remains to see."<br>
<br>"If thou," I straight replied, "hadst weigh'd the cause<br>
For which I look'd, thou hadst perchance excus'd<br>
The tarrying still." &nbsp;My leader part pursu'd<br>
His way, the while I follow'd, answering him,<br>
And adding thus: "Within that cave I deem,<br>
Whereon so fixedly I held my ken,<br>
There is a spirit dwells, one of my blood,<br>
Wailing the crime that costs him now so dear."<br>
<br>Then spake my master: "Let thy soul no more<br>
Afflict itself for him. &nbsp;Direct elsewhere<br>
Its thought, and leave him. &nbsp;At the bridge's foot<br>
I mark'd how he did point with menacing look<br>
At thee, and heard him by the others nam'd<br>
Geri of Bello. &nbsp;Thou so wholly then<br>
Wert busied with his spirit, who once rul'd<br>
The towers of Hautefort, that thou lookedst not<br>
That way, ere he was gone."&mdash;"O guide belov'd!<br>
His violent death yet unaveng'd," said I,<br>
"By any, who are partners in his shame,<br>
Made him contemptuous: therefore, as I think,<br>
He pass'd me speechless by; and doing so<br>
Hath made me more compassionate his fate."<br>
<br>So we discours'd to where the rock first show'd<br>
The other valley, had more light been there,<br>
E'en to the lowest depth. &nbsp;Soon as we came<br>
O'er the last cloister in the dismal rounds<br>
Of Malebolge, and the brotherhood<br>
Were to our view expos'd, then many a dart<br>
Of sore lament assail'd me, headed all<br>
With points of thrilling pity, that I clos'd<br>
Both ears against the volley with mine hands.<br>
<br>As were the torment, if each lazar-house<br>
Of Valdichiana, in the sultry time<br>
'Twixt July and September, with the isle<br>
Sardinia and Maremma's pestilent fen,<br>
Had heap'd their maladies all in one foss<br>
Together; such was here the torment: dire<br>
The stench, as issuing steams from fester'd limbs.<br>
<br>We on the utmost shore of the long rock<br>
Descended still to leftward. &nbsp;Then my sight<br>
Was livelier to explore the depth, wherein<br>
The minister of the most mighty Lord,<br>
All-searching Justice, dooms to punishment<br>
The forgers noted on her dread record.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/29-273.jpg"><img alt="29-273b.jpg (50K)" src="images/29-273b.jpg" height="564" width="356"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>More rueful was it not methinks to see<br>
The nation in Aegina droop, what time<br>
Each living thing, e'en to the little worm,<br>
All fell, so full of malice was the air<br>
(And afterward, as bards of yore have told,<br>
The ancient people were restor'd anew<br>
From seed of emmets) than was here to see<br>
The spirits, that languish'd through the murky vale<br>
Up-pil'd on many a stack. &nbsp;Confus'd they lay,<br>
One o'er the belly, o'er the shoulders one<br>
Roll'd of another; sideling crawl'd a third<br>
Along the dismal pathway. &nbsp;Step by step<br>
We journey'd on, in silence looking round<br>
And list'ning those diseas'd, who strove in vain<br>
To lift their forms. &nbsp;Then two I mark'd, that sat<br>
Propp'd 'gainst each other, as two brazen pans<br>
Set to retain the heat. &nbsp;From head to foot,<br>
A tetter bark'd them round. Nor saw I e'er<br>
Groom currying so fast, for whom his lord<br>
Impatient waited, or himself perchance<br>
Tir'd with long watching, as of these each one<br>
Plied quickly his keen nails, through furiousness<br>
Of ne'er abated pruriency. &nbsp;The crust<br>
Came drawn from underneath in flakes, like scales<br>
Scrap'd from the bream or fish of broader mail.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/29-275.jpg"><img alt="29-275b.jpg (63K)" src="images/29-275b.jpg" height="406" width="493"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>"O thou, who with thy fingers rendest off<br>
Thy coat of proof," thus spake my guide to one,<br>
"And sometimes makest tearing pincers of them,<br>
Tell me if any born of Latian land<br>
Be among these within: so may thy nails<br>
Serve thee for everlasting to this toil."<br>
<br>"Both are of Latium," weeping he replied,<br>
"Whom tortur'd thus thou seest: but who art thou<br>
That hast inquir'd of us?" &nbsp;To whom my guide:<br>
"One that descend with this man, who yet lives,<br>
From rock to rock, and show him hell's abyss."<br>
<br>Then started they asunder, and each turn'd<br>
Trembling toward us, with the rest, whose ear<br>
Those words redounding struck. &nbsp;To me my liege<br>
Address'd him: "Speak to them whate'er thou list."<br>
<br>And I therewith began: "So may no time<br>
Filch your remembrance from the thoughts of men<br>
In th' upper world, but after many suns<br>
Survive it, as ye tell me, who ye are,<br>
And of what race ye come. &nbsp;Your punishment,<br>
Unseemly and disgustful in its kind,<br>
Deter you not from opening thus much to me."<br>
<br>"Arezzo was my dwelling," answer'd one,<br>
"And me Albero of Sienna brought<br>
To die by fire; but that, for which I died,<br>
Leads me not here. &nbsp;True is in sport I told him,<br>
That I had learn'd to wing my flight in air.<br>
And he admiring much, as he was void<br>
Of wisdom, will'd me to declare to him<br>
The secret of mine art: and only hence,<br>
Because I made him not a Daedalus,<br>
Prevail'd on one suppos'd his sire to burn me.<br>
But Minos to this chasm last of the ten,<br>
For that I practis'd alchemy on earth,<br>
Has doom'd me. &nbsp;Him no subterfuge eludes."<br>
<br>Then to the bard I spake: "Was ever race<br>
Light as Sienna's? &nbsp;Sure not France herself<br>
Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain."<br>
<br>The other leprous spirit heard my words,<br>
And thus return'd: "Be Stricca from this charge<br>
Exempted, he who knew so temp'rately<br>
To lay out fortune's gifts; and Niccolo<br>
Who first the spice's costly luxury<br>
Discover'd in that garden, where such seed<br>
Roots deepest in the soil: and be that troop<br>
Exempted, with whom Caccia of Asciano<br>
Lavish'd his vineyards and wide-spreading woods,<br>
And his rare wisdom Abbagliato show'd<br>
A spectacle for all. &nbsp;That thou mayst know<br>
Who seconds thee against the Siennese<br>
Thus gladly, bend this way thy sharpen'd sight,<br>
That well my face may answer to thy ken;<br>
So shalt thou see I am Capocchio's ghost,<br>
Who forg'd transmuted metals by the power<br>
Of alchemy; and if I scan thee right,<br>
Thus needs must well remember how I aped<br>
Creative nature by my subtle art."</p>

<h2>CANTO XXX</h2>
<br>

<p>WHAT time resentment burn'd in Juno's breast<br>
For Semele against the Theban blood,<br>
As more than once in dire mischance was rued,<br>
Such fatal frenzy seiz'd on Athamas,<br>
That he his spouse beholding with a babe<br>
Laden on either arm, "Spread out," he cried,<br>
"The meshes, that I take the lioness<br>
And the young lions at the pass:" then forth<br>
Stretch'd he his merciless talons, grasping one,<br>
One helpless innocent, Learchus nam'd,<br>
Whom swinging down he dash'd upon a rock,<br>
And with her other burden self-destroy'd<br>
The hapless mother plung'd: and when the pride<br>
Of all-presuming Troy fell from its height,<br>
By fortune overwhelm'd, and the old king<br>
With his realm perish'd, then did Hecuba,<br>
A wretch forlorn and captive, when she saw<br>
Polyxena first slaughter'd, and her son,<br>
Her Polydorus, on the wild sea-beach<br>
Next met the mourner's view, then reft of sense<br>
Did she run barking even as a dog;<br>
Such mighty power had grief to wrench her soul.<br>
Bet ne'er the Furies or of Thebes or Troy<br>
With such fell cruelty were seen, their goads<br>
Infixing in the limbs of man or beast,<br>
As now two pale and naked ghost I saw<br>
That gnarling wildly scamper'd, like the swine<br>
Excluded from his stye. &nbsp;One reach'd Capocchio,<br>
And in the neck-joint sticking deep his fangs,<br>
Dragg'd him, that o'er the solid pavement rubb'd<br>
His belly stretch'd out prone. &nbsp;The other shape,<br>
He of Arezzo, there left trembling, spake;<br>
"That sprite of air is Schicchi; in like mood<br>
Of random mischief vent he still his spite."<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/30-281.jpg"><img alt="30-281b.jpg (62K)" src="images/30-281b.jpg" height="402" width="492"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>To whom I answ'ring: "Oh! as thou dost hope,<br>
The other may not flesh its jaws on thee,<br>
Be patient to inform us, who it is,<br>
Ere it speed hence."&mdash;"That is the ancient soul<br>
Of wretched Myrrha," he replied, "who burn'd<br>
With most unholy flame for her own sire,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/30-283.jpg"><img alt="30-283b.jpg (46K)" src="images/30-283b.jpg" height="537" width="352"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


"And a false shape assuming, so perform'd<br>
The deed of sin; e'en as the other there,<br>
That onward passes, dar'd to counterfeit<br>
Donati's features, to feign'd testament<br>
The seal affixing, that himself might gain,<br>
For his own share, the lady of the herd."<br>
<br>When vanish'd the two furious shades, on whom<br>
Mine eye was held, I turn'd it back to view<br>
The other cursed spirits. &nbsp;One I saw<br>
In fashion like a lute, had but the groin<br>
Been sever'd, where it meets the forked part.<br>
Swoln dropsy, disproportioning the limbs<br>
With ill-converted moisture, that the paunch<br>
Suits not the visage, open'd wide his lips<br>
Gasping as in the hectic man for drought,<br>
One towards the chin, the other upward curl'd.<br>
<br>"O ye, who in this world of misery,<br>
Wherefore I know not, are exempt from pain,"<br>
Thus he began, "attentively regard<br>
Adamo's woe. &nbsp;When living, full supply<br>
Ne'er lack'd me of what most I coveted;<br>
One drop of water now, alas! I crave.<br>
The rills, that glitter down the grassy slopes<br>
Of Casentino, making fresh and soft<br>
The banks whereby they glide to Arno's stream,<br>
Stand ever in my view; and not in vain;<br>
For more the pictur'd semblance dries me up,<br>
Much more than the disease, which makes the flesh<br>
Desert these shrivel'd cheeks. &nbsp;So from the place,<br>
Where I transgress'd, stern justice urging me,<br>
Takes means to quicken more my lab'ring sighs.<br>
There is Romena, where I falsified<br>
The metal with the Baptist's form imprest,<br>
For which on earth I left my body burnt.<br>
But if I here might see the sorrowing soul<br>
Of Guido, Alessandro, or their brother,<br>
For Branda's limpid spring I would not change<br>
The welcome sight. &nbsp;One is e'en now within,<br>
If truly the mad spirits tell, that round<br>
Are wand'ring. &nbsp;But wherein besteads me that?<br>
My limbs are fetter'd. &nbsp;Were I but so light,<br>
That I each hundred years might move one inch,<br>
I had set forth already on this path,<br>
Seeking him out amidst the shapeless crew,<br>
Although eleven miles it wind, not more<br>
Than half of one across. &nbsp;They brought me down<br>
Among this tribe; induc'd by them I stamp'd<br>
The florens with three carats of alloy."<br>
<br>"Who are that abject pair," I next inquir'd,<br>
"That closely bounding thee upon thy right<br>
Lie smoking, like a band in winter steep'd<br>
In the chill stream?"&mdash;"When to this gulf I dropt,"<br>
He answer'd, "here I found them; since that hour<br>
They have not turn'd, nor ever shall, I ween,<br>
Till time hath run his course. &nbsp;One is that dame<br>
The false accuser of the Hebrew youth;<br>
Sinon the other, that false Greek from Troy.<br>
Sharp fever drains the reeky moistness out,<br>
In such a cloud upsteam'd." &nbsp;When that he heard,<br>
One, gall'd perchance to be so darkly nam'd,<br>
With clench'd hand smote him on the braced paunch,<br>
That like a drum resounded: but forthwith<br>
Adamo smote him on the face, the blow<br>
Returning with his arm, that seem'd as hard.<br>
<br>"Though my o'erweighty limbs have ta'en from me<br>
The power to move," said he, "I have an arm<br>
At liberty for such employ." &nbsp;To whom<br>
Was answer'd: "When thou wentest to the fire,<br>
Thou hadst it not so ready at command,<br>
Then readier when it coin'd th' impostor gold."<br>
<br>And thus the dropsied: "Ay, now speak'st thou true.<br>
But there thou gav'st not such true testimony,<br>
When thou wast question'd of the truth, at Troy."<br>
<br>"If I spake false, thou falsely stamp'dst the coin,"<br>
Said Sinon; "I am here but for one fault,<br>
And thou for more than any imp beside."<br>
<br>"Remember," he replied, "O perjur'd one,<br>
The horse remember, that did teem with death,<br>
And all the world be witness to thy guilt."<br>
<br>"To thine," return'd the Greek, "witness the thirst<br>
Whence thy tongue cracks, witness the fluid mound,<br>
Rear'd by thy belly up before thine eyes,<br>
A mass corrupt." &nbsp;To whom the coiner thus:<br>
"Thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass<br>
Its evil saying. &nbsp;Me if thirst assails,<br>
Yet I am stuff'd with moisture. &nbsp;Thou art parch'd,<br>
Pains rack thy head, no urging would'st thou need<br>
To make thee lap Narcissus' mirror up."<br>
<br>I was all fix'd to listen, when my guide<br>
Admonish'd: "Now beware: a little more.<br>
And I do quarrel with thee." &nbsp;I perceiv'd<br>
How angrily he spake, and towards him turn'd<br>
With shame so poignant, as remember'd yet<br>
Confounds me. &nbsp;As a man that dreams of harm<br>
Befall'n him, dreaming wishes it a dream,<br>
And that which is, desires as if it were not,<br>
Such then was I, who wanting power to speak<br>
Wish'd to excuse myself, and all the while<br>
Excus'd me, though unweeting that I did.<br>
<br>"More grievous fault than thine has been, less shame,"<br>
My master cried, "might expiate. &nbsp;Therefore cast<br>
All sorrow from thy soul; and if again<br>
Chance bring thee, where like conference is held,<br>
Think I am ever at thy side. &nbsp;To hear<br>
Such wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="31"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XXXI</h2>
<br>

<p>THE very tongue, whose keen reproof before<br>
Had wounded me, that either cheek was stain'd,<br>
Now minister'd my cure. &nbsp;So have I heard,<br>
Achilles and his father's javelin caus'd<br>
Pain first, and then the boon of health restor'd.<br>
<br>Turning our back upon the vale of woe,<br>
W cross'd th' encircled mound in silence. &nbsp;There<br>
Was twilight dim, that far long the gloom<br>
Mine eye advanc'd not: but I heard a horn<br>
Sounded aloud. The peal it blew had made<br>
The thunder feeble. &nbsp;Following its course<br>
The adverse way, my strained eyes were bent<br>
On that one spot. &nbsp;So terrible a blast<br>
Orlando blew not, when that dismal rout<br>
O'erthrew the host of Charlemagne, and quench'd<br>
His saintly warfare. &nbsp;Thitherward not long<br>
My head was rais'd, when many lofty towers<br>
Methought I spied. &nbsp;"Master," said I, "what land<br>
Is this?" &nbsp;He answer'd straight: "Too long a space<br>
Of intervening darkness has thine eye<br>
To traverse: thou hast therefore widely err'd<br>
In thy imagining. &nbsp;Thither arriv'd<br>
Thou well shalt see, how distance can delude<br>
The sense. &nbsp;A little therefore urge thee on."<br>
<br>Then tenderly he caught me by the hand;<br>
"Yet know," said he, "ere farther we advance,<br>
That it less strange may seem, these are not towers,<br>
But giants. &nbsp;In the pit they stand immers'd,<br>
Each from his navel downward, round the bank."<br>
<br>As when a fog disperseth gradually,<br>
Our vision traces what the mist involves<br>
Condens'd in air; so piercing through the gross<br>
And gloomy atmosphere, as more and more<br>
We near'd toward the brink, mine error fled,<br>
And fear came o'er me. &nbsp;As with circling round<br>
Of turrets, Montereggion crowns his walls,<br>
E'en thus the shore, encompassing th' abyss,<br>
Was turreted with giants, half their length<br>
Uprearing, horrible, whom Jove from heav'n<br>
Yet threatens, when his mutt'ring thunder rolls.<br>
<br>Of one already I descried the face,<br>
Shoulders, and breast, and of the belly huge<br>
Great part, and both arms down along his ribs.<br>
<br>All-teeming nature, when her plastic hand<br>
Left framing of these monsters, did display<br>
Past doubt her wisdom, taking from mad War<br>
Such slaves to do his bidding; and if she<br>
Repent her not of th' elephant and whale,<br>
Who ponders well confesses her therein<br>
Wiser and more discreet; for when brute force<br>
And evil will are back'd with subtlety,<br>
Resistance none avails. &nbsp;His visage seem'd<br>
In length and bulk, as doth the pine, that tops<br>
Saint Peter's Roman fane; and th' other bones<br>
Of like proportion, so that from above<br>
The bank, which girdled him below, such height<br>
Arose his stature, that three Friezelanders<br>
Had striv'n in vain to reach but to his hair.<br>
Full thirty ample palms was he expos'd<br>
Downward from whence a man his garments loops.<br>
"Raphel bai ameth sabi almi,"<br>
So shouted his fierce lips, which sweeter hymns<br>
Became not; and my guide address'd him thus:<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/31-291.jpg"><img alt="31-291b.jpg (47K)" src="images/31-291b.jpg" height="556" width="352"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


"O senseless spirit! let thy horn for thee<br>
Interpret: therewith vent thy rage, if rage<br>
Or other passion wring thee. &nbsp;Search thy neck,<br>
There shalt thou find the belt that binds it on.<br>
Wild spirit! lo, upon thy mighty breast<br>
Where hangs the baldrick!" &nbsp;Then to me he spake:<br>
"He doth accuse himself. &nbsp;Nimrod is this,<br>
Through whose ill counsel in the world no more<br>
One tongue prevails. &nbsp;But pass we on, nor waste<br>
Our words; for so each language is to him,<br>
As his to others, understood by none."<br>
<br>Then to the leftward turning sped we forth,<br>
And at a sling's throw found another shade<br>
Far fiercer and more huge. &nbsp;I cannot say<br>
What master hand had girt him; but he held<br>
Behind the right arm fetter'd, and before<br>
The other with a chain, that fasten'd him<br>
From the neck down, and five times round his form<br>
Apparent met the wreathed links. &nbsp;"This proud one<br>
Would of his strength against almighty Jove<br>
Make trial," said my guide; "whence he is thus<br>
Requited: Ephialtes him they call.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/31-293.jpg"><img alt="31-293b.jpg (53K)" src="images/31-293b.jpg" height="410" width="496"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


"Great was his prowess, when the giants brought<br>
Fear on the gods: those arms, which then he piled,<br>
Now moves he never." &nbsp;Forthwith I return'd:<br>
"Fain would I, if 't were possible, mine eyes<br>
Of Briareus immeasurable gain'd<br>
Experience next." &nbsp;He answer'd: "Thou shalt see<br>
Not far from hence Antaeus, who both speaks<br>
And is unfetter'd, who shall place us there<br>
Where guilt is at its depth. &nbsp;Far onward stands<br>
Whom thou wouldst fain behold, in chains, and made<br>
Like to this spirit, save that in his looks<br>
More fell he seems." &nbsp;By violent earthquake rock'd<br>
Ne'er shook a tow'r, so reeling to its base,<br>
As Ephialtes. &nbsp;More than ever then<br>
I dreaded death, nor than the terror more<br>
Had needed, if I had not seen the cords<br>
That held him fast. &nbsp;We, straightway journeying on,<br>
Came to Antaeus, who five ells complete<br>
Without the head, forth issued from the cave.<br>
<br>"O thou, who in the fortunate vale, that made<br>
Great Scipio heir of glory, when his sword<br>
Drove back the troop of Hannibal in flight,<br>
Who thence of old didst carry for thy spoil<br>
An hundred lions; and if thou hadst fought<br>
In the high conflict on thy brethren's side,<br>
Seems as men yet believ'd, that through thine arm<br>
The sons of earth had conquer'd, now vouchsafe<br>
To place us down beneath, where numbing cold<br>
Locks up Cocytus. &nbsp;Force not that we crave<br>
Or Tityus' help or Typhon's. &nbsp;Here is one<br>
Can give what in this realm ye covet. &nbsp;Stoop<br>
Therefore, nor scornfully distort thy lip.<br>
He in the upper world can yet bestow<br>
Renown on thee, for he doth live, and looks<br>
For life yet longer, if before the time<br>
Grace call him not unto herself." &nbsp;Thus spake<br>
The teacher. &nbsp;He in haste forth stretch'd his hands,<br>
And caught my guide. &nbsp;Alcides whilom felt<br>
That grapple straighten'd score. &nbsp;Soon as my guide<br>
Had felt it, he bespake me thus: "This way<br>
That I may clasp thee;" then so caught me up,<br>
That we were both one burden. &nbsp;As appears<br>
The tower of Carisenda, from beneath<br>
Where it doth lean, if chance a passing cloud<br>
So sail across, that opposite it hangs,<br>
Such then Antaeus seem'd, as at mine ease<br>
I mark'd him stooping. &nbsp;I were fain at times<br>
T' have pass'd another way. &nbsp;Yet in th' abyss,<br>
That Lucifer with Judas low ingulfs,<br>
lightly he plac'd us; nor there leaning stay'd,<br>
But rose as in a bark the stately mast.</p>
