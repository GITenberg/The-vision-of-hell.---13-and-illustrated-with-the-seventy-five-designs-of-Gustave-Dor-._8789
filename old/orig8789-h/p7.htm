<h2>CANTO XVIII</h2>
<br>

<p>THERE is a place within the depths of hell<br>
Call'd Malebolge, all of rock dark-stain'd<br>
With hue ferruginous, e'en as the steep<br>
That round it circling winds. &nbsp;Right in the midst<br>
Of that abominable region, yawns<br>
A spacious gulf profound, whereof the frame<br>
Due time shall tell. &nbsp;The circle, that remains,<br>
Throughout its round, between the gulf and base<br>
Of the high craggy banks, successive forms<br>
Ten trenches, in its hollow bottom sunk.<br>
<br>As where to guard the walls, full many a foss<br>
Begirds some stately castle, sure defence<br>
Affording to the space within, so here<br>
Were model'd these; and as like fortresses<br>
E'en from their threshold to the brink without,<br>
Are flank'd with bridges; from the rock's low base<br>
Thus flinty paths advanc'd, that 'cross the moles<br>
And dikes, struck onward far as to the gulf,<br>
That in one bound collected cuts them off.<br>
Such was the place, wherein we found ourselves<br>
From Geryon's back dislodg'd. The bard to left<br>
Held on his way, and I behind him mov'd.<br>
<br>On our right hand new misery I saw,<br>
New pains, new executioners of wrath,<br>
That swarming peopled the first chasm. &nbsp;Below<br>
Were naked sinners. &nbsp;Hitherward they came,<br>
Meeting our faces from the middle point,<br>
With us beyond but with a larger stride.<br>
E'en thus the Romans, when the year returns<br>
Of Jubilee, with better speed to rid<br>
The thronging multitudes, their means devise<br>
For such as pass the bridge; that on one side<br>
All front toward the castle, and approach<br>
Saint Peter's fane, on th' other towards the mount.<br>
<br>Each divers way along the grisly rock,<br>
Horn'd demons I beheld, with lashes huge,<br>
That on their back unmercifully smote.<br>
Ah! how they made them bound at the first stripe!<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/18-177.jpg"><img alt="18-177b.jpg (51K)" src="images/18-177b.jpg" height="393" width="492"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


None for the second waited nor the third.<br>
<br>Meantime as on I pass'd, one met my sight<br>
Whom soon as view'd; "Of him," cried I, "not yet<br>
Mine eye hath had his fill." &nbsp;With fixed gaze<br>
I therefore scann'd him. &nbsp;Straight the teacher kind<br>
Paus'd with me, and consented I should walk<br>
Backward a space, and the tormented spirit,<br>
Who thought to hide him, bent his visage down.<br>
But it avail'd him nought; for I exclaim'd:<br>
"Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground,<br>
Unless thy features do belie thee much,<br>
Venedico art thou. &nbsp;But what brings thee<br>
Into this bitter seas'ning?" &nbsp;He replied:<br>
"Unwillingly I answer to thy words.<br>
But thy clear speech, that to my mind recalls<br>
The world I once inhabited, constrains me.<br>
Know then 'twas I who led fair Ghisola<br>
To do the Marquis' will, however fame<br>
The shameful tale have bruited. &nbsp;Nor alone<br>
Bologna hither sendeth me to mourn<br>
Rather with us the place is so o'erthrong'd<br>
That not so many tongues this day are taught,<br>
Betwixt the Reno and Savena's stream,<br>
To answer SIPA in their country's phrase.<br>
And if of that securer proof thou need,<br>
Remember but our craving thirst for gold."<br>
<br>Him speaking thus, a demon with his thong<br>
Struck, and exclaim'd, "Away! corrupter! here<br>
Women are none for sale." &nbsp;Forthwith I join'd<br>
My escort, and few paces thence we came<br>
To where a rock forth issued from the bank.<br>
That easily ascended, to the right<br>
Upon its splinter turning, we depart<br>
From those eternal barriers. When arriv'd,<br>
Where underneath the gaping arch lets pass<br>
The scourged souls: "Pause here," the teacher said,<br>
"And let these others miserable, now<br>
Strike on thy ken, faces not yet beheld,<br>
For that together they with us have walk'd."<br>
<br>From the old bridge we ey'd the pack, who came<br>
From th' other side towards us, like the rest,<br>
Excoriate from the lash. &nbsp;My gentle guide,<br>
By me unquestion'd, thus his speech resum'd:<br>
"Behold that lofty shade, who this way tends,<br>
And seems too woe-begone to drop a tear.<br>
How yet the regal aspect he retains!<br>
Jason is he, whose skill and prowess won<br>
The ram from Colchos. To the Lemnian isle<br>
His passage thither led him, when those bold<br>
And pitiless women had slain all their males.<br>
There he with tokens and fair witching words<br>
Hypsipyle beguil'd, a virgin young,<br>
Who first had all the rest herself beguil'd.<br>
Impregnated he left her there forlorn.<br>
Such is the guilt condemns him to this pain.<br>
Here too Medea's inj'ries are avenged.<br>
All bear him company, who like deceit<br>
To his have practis'd. &nbsp;And thus much to know<br>
Of the first vale suffice thee, and of those<br>
Whom its keen torments urge." &nbsp;Now had we come<br>
Where, crossing the next pier, the straighten'd path<br>
Bestrides its shoulders to another arch.<br>
<br>Hence in the second chasm we heard the ghosts,<br>
Who jibber in low melancholy sounds,<br>
With wide-stretch'd nostrils snort, and on themselves<br>
Smite with their palms. &nbsp;Upon the banks a scurf<br>
From the foul steam condens'd, encrusting hung,<br>
That held sharp combat with the sight and smell.<br>
<br>So hollow is the depth, that from no part,<br>
Save on the summit of the rocky span,<br>
Could I distinguish aught. &nbsp;Thus far we came;<br>
And thence I saw, within the foss below,<br>
A crowd immers'd in ordure, that appear'd<br>
Draff of the human body. &nbsp;There beneath<br>
Searching with eye inquisitive, I mark'd<br>
One with his head so grim'd, 't were hard to deem,<br>
If he were clerk or layman. &nbsp;Loud he cried:<br>
"Why greedily thus bendest more on me,<br>
Than on these other filthy ones, thy ken?"<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/18-181.jpg"><img alt="18-181b.jpg (46K)" src="images/18-181b.jpg" height="536" width="350"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>"Because if true my mem'ry," I replied,<br>
"I heretofore have seen thee with dry locks,<br>
And thou Alessio art of Lucca sprung.<br>
Therefore than all the rest I scan thee more."<br>
<br>Then beating on his brain these words he spake:<br>
"Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk,<br>
Wherewith I ne'er enough could glut my tongue."<br>
<br>My leader thus: "A little further stretch<br>
Thy face, that thou the visage well mayst note<br>
Of that besotted, sluttish courtezan,<br>
Who there doth rend her with defiled nails,<br>
Now crouching down, now risen on her feet.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/18-183.jpg"><img alt="18-183b.jpg (54K)" src="images/18-183b.jpg" height="541" width="355"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


"Thais is this, the harlot, whose false lip<br>
Answer'd her doting paramour that ask'd,<br>
'Thankest me much!'&mdash;'Say rather wondrously,'<br>
And seeing this here satiate be our view."</p>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XIX</h2>
<br>

<p>WOE to thee, Simon Magus! woe to you,<br>
His wretched followers! who the things of God,<br>
Which should be wedded unto goodness, them,<br>
Rapacious as ye are, do prostitute<br>
For gold and silver in adultery!<br>
Now must the trumpet sound for you, since yours<br>
Is the third chasm. &nbsp;Upon the following vault<br>
We now had mounted, where the rock impends<br>
Directly o'er the centre of the foss.<br>
<br>Wisdom Supreme! how wonderful the art,<br>
Which thou dost manifest in heaven, in earth,<br>
And in the evil world, how just a meed<br>
Allotting by thy virtue unto all!<br>
<br>I saw the livid stone, throughout the sides<br>
And in its bottom full of apertures,<br>
All equal in their width, and circular each,<br>
Nor ample less nor larger they appear'd<br>
Than in Saint John's fair dome of me belov'd<br>
Those fram'd to hold the pure baptismal streams,<br>
One of the which I brake, some few years past,<br>
To save a whelming infant; and be this<br>
A seal to undeceive whoever doubts<br>
The motive of my deed. &nbsp;From out the mouth<br>
Of every one, emerg'd a sinner's feet<br>
And of the legs high upward as the calf<br>
The rest beneath was hid. &nbsp;On either foot<br>
The soles were burning, whence the flexile joints<br>
Glanc'd with such violent motion, as had snapt<br>
Asunder cords or twisted withs. &nbsp;As flame,<br>
Feeding on unctuous matter, glides along<br>
The surface, scarcely touching where it moves;<br>
So here, from heel to point, glided the flames.<br>
<br>"Master! say who is he, than all the rest<br>
Glancing in fiercer agony, on whom<br>
A ruddier flame doth prey?" &nbsp;I thus inquir'd.<br>
<br>"If thou be willing," he replied, "that I<br>
Carry thee down, where least the slope bank falls,<br>
He of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs."<br>
<br>I then: "As pleases thee to me is best.<br>
Thou art my lord; and know'st that ne'er I quit<br>
Thy will: what silence hides that knowest thou."<br>
Thereat on the fourth pier we came, we turn'd,<br>
And on our left descended to the depth,<br>
A narrow strait and perforated close.<br>
Nor from his side my leader set me down,<br>
Till to his orifice he brought, whose limb<br>
Quiv'ring express'd his pang. &nbsp;"Whoe'er thou art,<br>
Sad spirit! thus revers'd, and as a stake<br>
Driv'n in the soil!" &nbsp;I in these words began,<br>
"If thou be able, utter forth thy voice."<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/19-187.jpg"><img alt="19-187b.jpg (43K)" src="images/19-187b.jpg" height="549" width="354"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>There stood I like the friar, that doth shrive<br>
A wretch for murder doom'd, who e'en when fix'd,<br>
Calleth him back, whence death awhile delays.<br>
<br>He shouted: "Ha! already standest there?<br>
Already standest there, O Boniface!<br>
By many a year the writing play'd me false.<br>
So early dost thou surfeit with the wealth,<br>
For which thou fearedst not in guile to take<br>
The lovely lady, and then mangle her?"<br>
<br>I felt as those who, piercing not the drift<br>
Of answer made them, stand as if expos'd<br>
In mockery, nor know what to reply,<br>
When Virgil thus admonish'd: "Tell him quick,<br>
I am not he, not he, whom thou believ'st."<br>
<br>And I, as was enjoin'd me, straight replied.<br>
<br>That heard, the spirit all did wrench his feet,<br>
And sighing next in woeful accent spake:<br>
"What then of me requirest?" &nbsp;"If to know<br>
So much imports thee, who I am, that thou<br>
Hast therefore down the bank descended, learn<br>
That in the mighty mantle I was rob'd,<br>
And of a she-bear was indeed the son,<br>
So eager to advance my whelps, that there<br>
My having in my purse above I stow'd,<br>
And here myself. &nbsp;Under my head are dragg'd<br>
The rest, my predecessors in the guilt<br>
Of simony. &nbsp;Stretch'd at their length they lie<br>
Along an opening in the rock. &nbsp;'Midst them<br>
I also low shall fall, soon as he comes,<br>
For whom I took thee, when so hastily<br>
I question'd. &nbsp;But already longer time<br>
Hath pass'd, since my souls kindled, and I thus<br>
Upturn'd have stood, than is his doom to stand<br>
Planted with fiery feet. &nbsp;For after him,<br>
One yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive,<br>
From forth the west, a shepherd without law,<br>
Fated to cover both his form and mine.<br>
He a new Jason shall be call'd, of whom<br>
In Maccabees we read; and favour such<br>
As to that priest his king indulgent show'd,<br>
Shall be of France's monarch shown to him."<br>
<br>I know not if I here too far presum'd,<br>
But in this strain I answer'd: "Tell me now,<br>
What treasures from St. Peter at the first<br>
Our Lord demanded, when he put the keys<br>
Into his charge? &nbsp;Surely he ask'd no more<br>
But, Follow me!  Nor Peter nor the rest<br>
Or gold or silver of Matthias took,<br>
When lots were cast upon the forfeit place<br>
Of the condemned soul. &nbsp;Abide thou then;<br>
Thy punishment of right is merited:<br>
And look thou well to that ill-gotten coin,<br>
Which against Charles thy hardihood inspir'd.<br>
If reverence of the keys restrain'd me not,<br>
Which thou in happier time didst hold, I yet<br>
Severer speech might use. &nbsp;Your avarice<br>
O'ercasts the world with mourning, under foot<br>
Treading the good, and raising bad men up.<br>
Of shepherds, like to you, th' Evangelist<br>
Was ware, when her, who sits upon the waves,<br>
With kings in filthy whoredom he beheld,<br>
She who with seven heads tower'd at her birth,<br>
And from ten horns her proof of glory drew,<br>
Long as her spouse in virtue took delight.<br>
Of gold and silver ye have made your god,<br>
Diff'ring wherein from the idolater,<br>
But he that worships one, a hundred ye?<br>
Ah, Constantine! to how much ill gave birth,<br>
Not thy conversion, but that plenteous dower,<br>
Which the first wealthy Father gain'd from thee!"<br>
<br>Meanwhile, as thus I sung, he, whether wrath<br>
Or conscience smote him, violent upsprang<br>
Spinning on either sole. &nbsp;I do believe<br>
My teacher well was pleas'd, with so compos'd<br>
A lip, he listen'd ever to the sound<br>
Of the true words I utter'd. &nbsp;In both arms<br>
He caught, and to his bosom lifting me<br>
Upward retrac'd the way of his descent.<br>
<br>Nor weary of his weight he press'd me close,<br>
Till to the summit of the rock we came,<br>
Our passage from the fourth to the fifth pier.<br>
His cherish'd burden there gently he plac'd<br>
Upon the rugged rock and steep, a path<br>
Not easy for the clamb'ring goat to mount.<br>
<br>Thence to my view another vale appear'd</p>

<br><br>
<a name="20"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XX</h2>
<br>

<p>AND now the verse proceeds to torments new,<br>
Fit argument of this the twentieth strain<br>
Of the first song, whose awful theme records<br>
The spirits whelm'd in woe. &nbsp;Earnest I look'd<br>
Into the depth, that open'd to my view,<br>
Moisten'd with tears of anguish, and beheld<br>
A tribe, that came along the hollow vale,<br>
In silence weeping: such their step as walk<br>
Quires chanting solemn litanies on earth.<br>
<br>As on them more direct mine eye descends,<br>
Each wondrously seem'd to be revers'd<br>
At the neck-bone, so that the countenance<br>
Was from the reins averted: and because<br>
None might before him look, they were compell'd<br>
To' advance with backward gait. &nbsp;Thus one perhaps<br>
Hath been by force of palsy clean transpos'd,<br>
But I ne'er saw it nor believe it so.<br>
<br>Now, reader! think within thyself, so God<br>
Fruit of thy reading give thee! how I long<br>
Could keep my visage dry, when I beheld<br>
Near me our form distorted in such guise,<br>
That on the hinder parts fall'n from the face<br>
The tears down-streaming roll'd. &nbsp;Against a rock<br>
I leant and wept, so that my guide exclaim'd:<br>
"What, and art thou too witless as the rest?<br>
Here pity most doth show herself alive,<br>
When she is dead. &nbsp;What guilt exceedeth his,<br>
Who with Heaven's judgment in his passion strives?<br>
Raise up thy head, raise up, and see the man,<br>
Before whose eyes earth gap'd in Thebes, when all<br>
Cried out, 'Amphiaraus, whither rushest?<br>
'Why leavest thou the war?' &nbsp;He not the less<br>
Fell ruining far as to Minos down,<br>
Whose grapple none eludes. &nbsp;Lo! how he makes<br>
The breast his shoulders, and who once too far<br>
Before him wish'd to see, now backward looks,<br>
And treads reverse his path. &nbsp;Tiresias note,<br>
Who semblance chang'd, when woman he became<br>
Of male, through every limb transform'd, and then<br>
Once more behov'd him with his rod to strike<br>
The two entwining serpents, ere the plumes,<br>
That mark'd the better sex, might shoot again.<br>
<br>"Aruns, with more his belly facing, comes.<br>
On Luni's mountains 'midst the marbles white,<br>
Where delves Carrara's hind, who wons beneath,<br>
A cavern was his dwelling, whence the stars<br>
And main-sea wide in boundless view he held.<br>
<br>"The next, whose loosen'd tresses overspread<br>
Her bosom, which thou seest not (for each hair<br>
On that side grows) was Manto, she who search'd<br>
Through many regions, and at length her seat<br>
Fix'd in my native land, whence a short space<br>
My words detain thy audience. &nbsp;When her sire<br>
From life departed, and in servitude<br>
The city dedicate to Bacchus mourn'd,<br>
Long time she went a wand'rer through the world.<br>
Aloft in Italy's delightful land<br>
A lake there lies, at foot of that proud Alp,<br>
That o'er the Tyrol locks Germania in,<br>
Its name Benacus, which a thousand rills,<br>
Methinks, and more, water between the vale<br>
Camonica and Garda and the height<br>
Of Apennine remote. &nbsp;There is a spot<br>
At midway of that lake, where he who bears<br>
Of Trento's flock the past'ral staff, with him<br>
Of Brescia, and the Veronese, might each<br>
Passing that way his benediction give.<br>
A garrison of goodly site and strong<br>
Peschiera stands, to awe with front oppos'd<br>
The Bergamese and Brescian, whence the shore<br>
More slope each way descends. &nbsp;There, whatsoev'er<br>
Benacus' bosom holds not, tumbling o'er<br>
Down falls, and winds a river flood beneath<br>
Through the green pastures. &nbsp;Soon as in his course<br>
The steam makes head, Benacus then no more<br>
They call the name, but Mincius, till at last<br>
Reaching Governo into Po he falls.<br>
Not far his course hath run, when a wide flat<br>
It finds, which overstretchmg as a marsh<br>
It covers, pestilent in summer oft.<br>
Hence journeying, the savage maiden saw<br>
'Midst of the fen a territory waste<br>
And naked of inhabitants. &nbsp;To shun<br>
All human converse, here she with her slaves<br>
Plying her arts remain'd, and liv'd, and left<br>
Her body tenantless. &nbsp;Thenceforth the tribes,<br>
Who round were scatter'd, gath'ring to that place<br>
Assembled; for its strength was great, enclos'd<br>
On all parts by the fen. &nbsp;On those dead bones<br>
They rear'd themselves a city, for her sake,<br>
Calling it Mantua, who first chose the spot,<br>
Nor ask'd another omen for the name,<br>
Wherein more numerous the people dwelt,<br>
Ere Casalodi's madness by deceit<br>
Was wrong'd of Pinamonte. &nbsp;If thou hear<br>
Henceforth another origin assign'd<br>
Of that my country, I forewarn thee now,<br>
That falsehood none beguile thee of the truth."<br>
<br>I answer'd: "Teacher, I conclude thy words<br>
So certain, that all else shall be to me<br>
As embers lacking life. &nbsp;But now of these,<br>
Who here proceed, instruct me, if thou see<br>
Any that merit more especial note.<br>
For thereon is my mind alone intent."<br>
<br>He straight replied: "That spirit, from whose cheek<br>
The beard sweeps o'er his shoulders brown, what time<br>
Graecia was emptied of her males, that scarce<br>
The cradles were supplied, the seer was he<br>
In Aulis, who with Calchas gave the sign<br>
When first to cut the cable. &nbsp;Him they nam'd<br>
Eurypilus: so sings my tragic strain,<br>
In which majestic measure well thou know'st,<br>
Who know'st it all. &nbsp;That other, round the loins<br>
So slender of his shape, was Michael Scot,<br>
Practis'd in ev'ry slight of magic wile.<br>
<br>"Guido Bonatti see: &nbsp;Asdente mark,<br>
Who now were willing, he had tended still<br>
The thread and cordwain; and too late repents.<br>
<br>"See next the wretches, who the needle left,<br>
The shuttle and the spindle, and became<br>
Diviners: baneful witcheries they wrought<br>
With images and herbs. &nbsp;But onward now:<br>
For now doth Cain with fork of thorns confine<br>
On either hemisphere, touching the wave<br>
Beneath the towers of Seville. &nbsp;Yesternight<br>
The moon was round. &nbsp;Thou mayst remember well:<br>
For she good service did thee in the gloom<br>
Of the deep wood." &nbsp;This said, both onward mov'd.</p>

<h2>CANTO XXI</h2>
<br>

<p>THUS we from bridge to bridge, with other talk,<br>
The which my drama cares not to rehearse,<br>
Pass'd on; and to the summit reaching, stood<br>
To view another gap, within the round<br>
Of Malebolge, other bootless pangs.<br>
<br>Marvelous darkness shadow'd o'er the place.<br>
<br>In the Venetians' arsenal as boils<br>
Through wintry months tenacious pitch, to smear<br>
Their unsound vessels; for th' inclement time<br>
Sea-faring men restrains, and in that while<br>
His bark one builds anew, another stops<br>
The ribs of his, that hath made many a voyage;<br>
One hammers at the prow, one at the poop;<br>
This shapeth oars, that other cables twirls,<br>
The mizen one repairs and main-sail rent<br>
So not by force of fire but art divine<br>
Boil'd here a glutinous thick mass, that round<br>
Lim'd all the shore beneath. &nbsp;I that beheld,<br>
But therein nought distinguish'd, save the surge,<br>
Rais'd by the boiling, in one mighty swell<br>
Heave, and by turns subsiding and fall. &nbsp;While there<br>
I fix'd my ken below, "Mark! mark!" my guide<br>
Exclaiming, drew me towards him from the place,<br>
Wherein I stood. &nbsp;I turn'd myself as one,<br>
Impatient to behold that which beheld<br>
He needs must shun, whom sudden fear unmans,<br>
That he his flight delays not for the view.<br>
Behind me I discern'd a devil black,<br>
That running, up advanc'd along the rock.<br>
Ah! what fierce cruelty his look bespake!<br>
In act how bitter did he seem, with wings<br>
Buoyant outstretch'd and feet of nimblest tread!<br>
His shoulder proudly eminent and sharp<br>
Was with a sinner charg'd; by either haunch<br>
He held him, the foot's sinew griping fast.<br>
<br>"Ye of our bridge!" he cried, "keen-talon'd fiends!<br>
Lo! one of Santa Zita's elders! Him<br>
Whelm ye beneath, while I return for more.<br>
That land hath store of such. &nbsp;All men are there,<br>
Except Bonturo, barterers: of 'no'<br>
For lucre there an 'aye' is quickly made."<br>
<br>Him dashing down, o'er the rough rock he turn'd,<br>
Nor ever after thief a mastiff loos'd<br>
Sped with like eager haste. &nbsp;That other sank<br>
And forthwith writing to the surface rose.<br>
But those dark demons, shrouded by the bridge,<br>
Cried "Here the hallow'd visage saves not: here<br>
Is other swimming than in Serchio's wave.<br>
Wherefore if thou desire we rend thee not,<br>
Take heed thou mount not o'er the pitch." &nbsp;This said,<br>
They grappled him with more than hundred hooks,<br>
And shouted: "Cover'd thou must sport thee here;<br>
So, if thou canst, in secret mayst thou filch."<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/21-201.jpg"><img alt="21-201b.jpg (61K)" src="images/21-201b.jpg" height="402" width="490"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


E'en thus the cook bestirs him, with his grooms,<br>
To thrust the flesh into the caldron down<br>
With flesh-hooks, that it float not on the top.<br>
<br>Me then my guide bespake: "Lest they descry,<br>
That thou art here, behind a craggy rock<br>
Bend low and screen thee; and whate'er of force<br>
Be offer'd me, or insult, fear thou not:<br>
For I am well advis'd, who have been erst<br>
In the like fray." &nbsp;Beyond the bridge's head<br>
Therewith he pass'd, and reaching the sixth pier,<br>
Behov'd him then a forehead terror-proof.<br>
<br>With storm and fury, as when dogs rush forth<br>
Upon the poor man's back, who suddenly<br>
From whence he standeth makes his suit; so rush'd<br>
Those from beneath the arch, and against him<br>
Their weapons all they pointed. &nbsp;He aloud:<br>
"Be none of you outrageous: ere your time<br>
Dare seize me, come forth from amongst you one,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/21-205.jpg"><img alt="21-205b.jpg (44K)" src="images/21-205b.jpg" height="399" width="489"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


"Who having heard my words, decide he then<br>
If he shall tear these limbs." &nbsp;They shouted loud,<br>
"Go, Malacoda!" &nbsp;Whereat one advanc'd,<br>
The others standing firm, and as he came,<br>
"What may this turn avail him?" he exclaim'd.<br>
<br>"Believ'st thou, Malacoda! I had come<br>
Thus far from all your skirmishing secure,"<br>
My teacher answered, "without will divine<br>
And destiny propitious? &nbsp;Pass we then<br>
For so Heaven's pleasure is, that I should lead<br>
Another through this savage wilderness."<br>
<br>Forthwith so fell his pride, that he let drop<br>
The instrument of torture at his feet,<br>
And to the rest exclaim'd: "We have no power<br>
To strike him." &nbsp;Then to me my guide: "O thou!<br>
Who on the bridge among the crags dost sit<br>
Low crouching, safely now to me return."<br>
<br>I rose, and towards him moved with speed: the fiends<br>
Meantime all forward drew: me terror seiz'd<br>
Lest they should break the compact they had made.<br>
Thus issuing from Caprona, once I saw<br>
Th' infantry dreading, lest his covenant<br>
The foe should break; so close he hemm'd them round.<br>
<br>I to my leader's side adher'd, mine eyes<br>
With fixt and motionless observance bent<br>
On their unkindly visage. &nbsp;They their hooks<br>
Protruding, one the other thus bespake:<br>
"Wilt thou I touch him on the hip?" &nbsp;To whom<br>
Was answer'd: "Even so; nor miss thy aim."<br>
<br>But he, who was in conf'rence with my guide,<br>
Turn'd rapid round, and thus the demon spake:<br>
"Stay, stay thee, Scarmiglione!" &nbsp;Then to us<br>
He added: "Further footing to your step<br>
This rock affords not, shiver'd to the base<br>
Of the sixth arch. &nbsp;But would you still proceed,<br>
Up by this cavern go: not distant far,<br>
Another rock will yield you passage safe.<br>
Yesterday, later by five hours than now,<br>
Twelve hundred threescore years and six had fill'd<br>
The circuit of their course, since here the way<br>
Was broken. &nbsp;Thitherward I straight dispatch<br>
Certain of these my scouts, who shall espy<br>
If any on the surface bask. &nbsp;With them<br>
Go ye: for ye shall find them nothing fell.<br>
Come Alichino forth," with that he cried,<br>
"And Calcabrina, and Cagnazzo thou!<br>
The troop of ten let Barbariccia lead.<br>
With Libicocco Draghinazzo haste,<br>
Fang'd Ciriatto, Grafflacane fierce,<br>
And Farfarello, and mad Rubicant.<br>
Search ye around the bubbling tar. &nbsp;For these,<br>
In safety lead them, where the other crag<br>
Uninterrupted traverses the dens."<br>
<br>I then: "O master! what a sight is there!<br>
Ah! without escort, journey we alone,<br>
Which, if thou know the way, I covet not.<br>
Unless thy prudence fail thee, dost not mark<br>
How they do gnarl upon us, and their scowl<br>
Threatens us present tortures?" &nbsp;He replied:<br>
"I charge thee fear not: let them, as they will,<br>
Gnarl on: 't is but in token of their spite<br>
Against the souls, who mourn in torment steep'd."<br>
<br>To leftward o'er the pier they turn'd; but each<br>
Had first between his teeth prest close the tongue,<br>
Toward their leader for a signal looking,<br>
Which he with sound obscene triumphant gave.</p>

<a name="22"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XXII</h2>
<br>

<p>IT hath been heretofore my chance to see<br>
Horsemen with martial order shifting camp,<br>
To onset sallying, or in muster rang'd,<br>
Or in retreat sometimes outstretch'd for flight;<br>
Light-armed squadrons and fleet foragers<br>
Scouring thy plains, Arezzo! have I seen,<br>
And clashing tournaments, and tilting jousts,<br>
Now with the sound of trumpets, now of bells,<br>
Tabors, or signals made from castled heights,<br>
And with inventions multiform, our own,<br>
Or introduc'd from foreign land; but ne'er<br>
To such a strange recorder I beheld,<br>
In evolution moving, horse nor foot,<br>
Nor ship, that tack'd by sign from land or star.<br>
<br>With the ten demons on our way we went;<br>
Ah fearful company! but in the church<br>
With saints, with gluttons at the tavern's mess.<br>
<br>Still earnest on the pitch I gaz'd, to mark<br>
All things whate'er the chasm contain'd, and those<br>
Who burn'd within. &nbsp;As dolphins, that, in sign<br>
To mariners, heave high their arched backs,<br>
That thence forewarn'd they may advise to save<br>
Their threaten'd vessels; so, at intervals,<br>
To ease the pain his back some sinner show'd,<br>
Then hid more nimbly than the lightning glance.<br>
<br>E'en as the frogs, that of a wat'ry moat<br>
Stand at the brink, with the jaws only out,<br>
Their feet and of the trunk all else concealed,<br>
Thus on each part the sinners stood, but soon<br>
As Barbariccia was at hand, so they<br>
Drew back under the wave. &nbsp;I saw, and yet<br>
My heart doth stagger, one, that waited thus,<br>
As it befalls that oft one frog remains,<br>
While the next springs away: and Graffiacan,<br>
Who of the fiends was nearest, grappling seiz'd<br>
His clotted locks, and dragg'd him sprawling up,<br>
That he appear'd to me an otter. &nbsp;Each<br>
Already by their names I knew, so well<br>
When they were chosen, I observ'd, and mark'd<br>
How one the other call'd. "O Rubicant!<br>
See that his hide thou with thy talons flay,"<br>
Shouted together all the cursed crew.<br>
<br>Then I: "Inform thee, master! if thou may,<br>
What wretched soul is this, on whom their hand<br>
His foes have laid." &nbsp;My leader to his side<br>
Approach'd, and whence he came inquir'd, to whom<br>
Was answer'd thus: "Born in Navarre's domain<br>
My mother plac'd me in a lord's retinue,<br>
For she had borne me to a losel vile,<br>
A spendthrift of his substance and himself.<br>
The good king Thibault after that I serv'd,<br>
To peculating here my thoughts were turn'd,<br>
Whereof I give account in this dire heat."<br>
<br>Straight Ciriatto, from whose mouth a tusk<br>
Issued on either side, as from a boar,<br>
Ript him with one of these. &nbsp;'Twixt evil claws<br>
The mouse had fall'n: but Barbariccia cried,<br>
Seizing him with both arms: "Stand thou apart,<br>
While I do fix him on my prong transpierc'd."<br>
Then added, turning to my guide his face,<br>
"Inquire of him, if more thou wish to learn,<br>
Ere he again be rent." &nbsp;My leader thus:<br>
"Then tell us of the partners in thy guilt;<br>
Knowest thou any sprung of Latian land<br>
Under the tar?"&mdash;"I parted," he replied,<br>
"But now from one, who sojourn'd not far thence;<br>
So were I under shelter now with him!<br>
Nor hook nor talon then should scare me more."&mdash;.<br>
<br>"Too long we suffer," Libicocco cried,<br>
Then, darting forth a prong, seiz'd on his arm,<br>
And mangled bore away the sinewy part.<br>
Him Draghinazzo by his thighs beneath<br>
Would next have caught, whence angrily their chief,<br>
Turning on all sides round, with threat'ning brow<br>
Restrain'd them. &nbsp;When their strife a little ceas'd,<br>
Of him, who yet was gazing on his wound,<br>
My teacher thus without delay inquir'd:<br>
"Who was the spirit, from whom by evil hap<br>
Parting, as thou has told, thou cam'st to shore?"&mdash;<br>
<br>"It was the friar Gomita," he rejoin'd,<br>
"He of Gallura, vessel of all guile,<br>
Who had his master's enemies in hand,<br>
And us'd them so that they commend him well.<br>
Money he took, and them at large dismiss'd.<br>
So he reports: and in each other charge<br>
Committed to his keeping, play'd the part<br>
Of barterer to the height: &nbsp;with him doth herd<br>
The chief of Logodoro, Michel Zanche.<br>
Sardinia is a theme, whereof their tongue<br>
Is never weary. &nbsp;Out! alas! behold<br>
That other, how he grins! More would I say,<br>
But tremble lest he mean to maul me sore."<br>
<br>Their captain then to Farfarello turning,<br>
Who roll'd his moony eyes in act to strike,<br>
Rebuk'd him thus: "Off! cursed bird! Avaunt!"&mdash;<br>
<br>"If ye desire to see or hear," he thus<br>
Quaking with dread resum'd, "or Tuscan spirits<br>
Or Lombard, I will cause them to appear.<br>
Meantime let these ill talons bate their fury,<br>
So that no vengeance they may fear from them,<br>
And I, remaining in this self-same place,<br>
Will for myself but one, make sev'n appear,<br>
When my shrill whistle shall be heard; for so<br>
Our custom is to call each other up."<br>
<br>Cagnazzo at that word deriding grinn'd,<br>
Then wagg'd the head and spake: "Hear his device,<br>
Mischievous as he is, to plunge him down."<br>
<br>Whereto he thus, who fail'd not in rich store<br>
Of nice-wove toils; "Mischief forsooth extreme,<br>
Meant only to procure myself more woe!"<br>
<br>No longer Alichino then refrain'd,<br>
But thus, the rest gainsaying, him bespake:<br>
"If thou do cast thee down, I not on foot<br>
Will chase thee, but above the pitch will beat<br>
My plumes. &nbsp;Quit we the vantage ground, and let<br>
The bank be as a shield, that we may see<br>
If singly thou prevail against us all."<br>
<br>Now, reader, of new sport expect to hear!<br>
<br>They each one turn'd his eyes to the' other shore,<br>
He first, who was the hardest to persuade.<br>
The spirit of Navarre chose well his time,<br>
Planted his feet on land, and at one leap<br>
Escaping disappointed their resolve.<br>
<br>Them quick resentment stung, but him the most,<br>
Who was the cause of failure; in pursuit<br>
He therefore sped, exclaiming: "Thou art caught."<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/22-213.jpg"><img alt="22-213b.jpg (45K)" src="images/22-213b.jpg" height="396" width="492"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>But little it avail'd: terror outstripp'd<br>
His following flight: the other plung'd beneath,<br>
And he with upward pinion rais'd his breast:<br>
E'en thus the water-fowl, when she perceives<br>
The falcon near, dives instant down, while he<br>
Enrag'd and spent retires. &nbsp;That mockery<br>
In Calcabrina fury stirr'd, who flew<br>
After him, with desire of strife inflam'd;<br>
And, for the barterer had 'scap'd, so turn'd<br>
His talons on his comrade. O'er the dyke<br>
In grapple close they join'd; but the' other prov'd<br>
A goshawk able to rend well his foe;<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/22-215.jpg"><img alt="22-215b.jpg (45K)" src="images/22-215b.jpg" height="544" width="356"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


And in the boiling lake both fell. &nbsp;The heat<br>
Was umpire soon between them, but in vain<br>
To lift themselves they strove, so fast were glued<br>
Their pennons. &nbsp;Barbariccia, as the rest,<br>
That chance lamenting, four in flight dispatch'd<br>
From the' other coast, with all their weapons arm'd.<br>
They, to their post on each side speedily<br>
Descending, stretch'd their hooks toward the fiends,<br>
Who flounder'd, inly burning from their scars:<br>
And we departing left them to that broil.</p>
