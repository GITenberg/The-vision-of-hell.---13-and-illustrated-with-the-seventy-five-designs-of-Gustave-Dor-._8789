<h2>CANTO XXXII</h2>
<br>

<p>COULD I command rough rhimes and hoarse, to suit<br>
That hole of sorrow, o'er which ev'ry rock<br>
His firm abutment rears, then might the vein<br>
Of fancy rise full springing: but not mine<br>
Such measures, and with falt'ring awe I touch<br>
The mighty theme; for to describe the depth<br>
Of all the universe, is no emprize<br>
To jest with, and demands a tongue not us'd<br>
To infant babbling. &nbsp;But let them assist<br>
My song, the tuneful maidens, by whose aid<br>
Amphion wall'd in Thebes, so with the truth<br>
My speech shall best accord. &nbsp;Oh ill-starr'd folk,<br>
Beyond all others wretched! who abide<br>
In such a mansion, as scarce thought finds words<br>
To speak of, better had ye here on earth<br>
Been flocks or mountain goats. &nbsp;As down we stood<br>
In the dark pit beneath the giants' feet,<br>
But lower far than they, and I did gaze<br>
Still on the lofty battlement, a voice<br>
Bespoke me thus: "Look how thou walkest. &nbsp;Take<br>
Good heed, thy soles do tread not on the heads<br>
Of thy poor brethren." &nbsp;Thereupon I turn'd,<br>
And saw before and underneath my feet<br>
A lake, whose frozen surface liker seem'd<br>
To glass than water. &nbsp;Not so thick a veil<br>
In winter e'er hath Austrian Danube spread<br>
O'er his still course, nor Tanais far remote<br>
Under the chilling sky. &nbsp;Roll'd o'er that mass<br>
Had Tabernich or Pietrapana fall'n,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/32-301.jpg"><img alt="32-301b.jpg (32K)" src="images/32-301b.jpg" height="413" width="490"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Not e'en its rim had creak'd. As peeps the frog<br>
Croaking above the wave, what time in dreams<br>
The village gleaner oft pursues her toil,<br>
So, to where modest shame appears, thus low<br>
Blue pinch'd and shrin'd in ice the spirits stood,<br>
Moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork.<br>
His face each downward held; their mouth the cold,<br>
Their eyes express'd the dolour of their heart.<br>
<br>A space I look'd around, then at my feet<br>
Saw two so strictly join'd, that of their head<br>
The very hairs were mingled. &nbsp;"Tell me ye,<br>
Whose bosoms thus together press," said I,<br>
"Who are ye?" &nbsp;At that sound their necks they bent,<br>
And when their looks were lifted up to me,<br>
Straightway their eyes, before all moist within,<br>
Distill'd upon their lips, and the frost bound<br>
The tears betwixt those orbs and held them there.<br>
Plank unto plank hath never cramp clos'd up<br>
So stoutly. &nbsp;Whence like two enraged goats<br>
They clash'd together; them such fury seiz'd.<br>
<br>And one, from whom the cold both ears had reft,<br>
Exclaim'd, still looking downward: "Why on us<br>
Dost speculate so long? &nbsp;If thou wouldst know<br>
Who are these two, the valley, whence his wave<br>
Bisenzio slopes, did for its master own<br>
Their sire Alberto, and next him themselves.<br>
They from one body issued; and throughout<br>
Caina thou mayst search, nor find a shade<br>
More worthy in congealment to be fix'd,<br>
Not him, whose breast and shadow Arthur's land<br>
At that one blow dissever'd, not Focaccia,<br>
No not this spirit, whose o'erjutting head<br>
Obstructs my onward view: he bore the name<br>
Of Mascheroni: Tuscan if thou be,<br>
Well knowest who he was: and to cut short<br>
All further question, in my form behold<br>
What once was Camiccione. &nbsp;I await<br>
Carlino here my kinsman, whose deep guilt<br>
Shall wash out mine." &nbsp;A thousand visages<br>
Then mark'd I, which the keen and eager cold<br>
Had shap'd into a doggish grin; whence creeps<br>
A shiv'ring horror o'er me, at the thought<br>
Of those frore shallows. &nbsp;While we journey'd on<br>
Toward the middle, at whose point unites<br>
All heavy substance, and I trembling went<br>
Through that eternal chillness, I know not<br>
If will it were or destiny, or chance,<br>
But, passing 'midst the heads, my foot did strike<br>
With violent blow against the face of one.<br>
<br>"Wherefore dost bruise me?" weeping, he exclaim'd,<br>
"Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge<br>
For Montaperto, wherefore troublest me?"<br>
<br>I thus: "Instructor, now await me here,<br>
That I through him may rid me of my doubt.<br>
Thenceforth what haste thou wilt." &nbsp;The teacher paus'd,<br>
And to that shade I spake, who bitterly<br>
Still curs'd me in his wrath. &nbsp;"What art thou, speak,<br>
That railest thus on others?" &nbsp;He replied:<br>
"Now who art thou, that smiting others' cheeks<br>
Through Antenora roamest, with such force<br>
As were past suff'rance, wert thou living still?"<br>
<br>"And I am living, to thy joy perchance,"<br>
Was my reply, "if fame be dear to thee,<br>
That with the rest I may thy name enrol."<br>
<br>"The contrary of what I covet most,"<br>
Said he, "thou tender'st: hence; nor vex me more.<br>
Ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale."<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/32-305.jpg"><img alt="32-305b.jpg (40K)" src="images/32-305b.jpg" height="406" width="489"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>Then seizing on his hinder scalp, I cried:<br>
"Name thee, or not a hair shall tarry here."<br>
<br>"Rend all away," he answer'd, "yet for that<br>
I will not tell nor show thee who I am,<br>
Though at my head thou pluck a thousand times."<br>
<br>Now I had grasp'd his tresses, and stript off<br>
More than one tuft, he barking, with his eyes<br>
Drawn in and downward, when another cried,<br>
"What ails thee, Bocca? &nbsp;Sound not loud enough<br>
Thy chatt'ring teeth, but thou must bark outright?<br>
"What devil wrings thee?"&mdash;"Now," said I, "be dumb,<br>
Accursed traitor! to thy shame of thee<br>
True tidings will I bear."&mdash;"Off," he replied,<br>
"Tell what thou list; but as thou escape from hence<br>
To speak of him whose tongue hath been so glib,<br>
Forget not: here he wails the Frenchman's gold.<br>
'Him of Duera,' thou canst say, 'I mark'd,<br>
Where the starv'd sinners pine.' &nbsp;If thou be ask'd<br>
What other shade was with them, at thy side<br>
Is Beccaria, whose red gorge distain'd<br>
The biting axe of Florence. &nbsp;Farther on,<br>
If I misdeem not, Soldanieri bides,<br>
With Ganellon, and Tribaldello, him<br>
Who op'd Faenza when the people slept."<br>
<br>We now had left him, passing on our way,<br>
When I beheld two spirits by the ice<br>
Pent in one hollow, that the head of one<br>
Was cowl unto the other; and as bread<br>
Is raven'd up through hunger, th' uppermost<br>
Did so apply his fangs to th' other's brain,<br>
Where the spine joins it. &nbsp;Not more furiously<br>
On Menalippus' temples Tydeus gnaw'd,<br>
Than on that skull and on its garbage he.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/32-309.jpg"><img alt="32-309b.jpg (53K)" src="images/32-309b.jpg" height="412" width="492"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>"O thou who show'st so beastly sign of hate<br>
'Gainst him thou prey'st on, let me hear," said I<br>
"The cause, on such condition, that if right<br>
Warrant thy grievance, knowing who ye are,<br>
And what the colour of his sinning was,<br>
I may repay thee in the world above,<br>
If that, wherewith I speak be moist so long."</p>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XXXIII</h2>
<br>

<p>HIS jaws uplifting from their fell repast,<br>
That sinner wip'd them on the hairs o' th' head,<br>
Which he behind had mangled, then began:<br>
"Thy will obeying, I call up afresh<br>
Sorrow past cure, which but to think of wrings<br>
My heart, or ere I tell on't. But if words,<br>
That I may utter, shall prove seed to bear<br>
Fruit of eternal infamy to him,<br>
The traitor whom I gnaw at, thou at once<br>
Shalt see me speak and weep. &nbsp;Who thou mayst be<br>
I know not, nor how here below art come:<br>
But Florentine thou seemest of a truth,<br>
When I do hear thee. &nbsp;Know I was on earth<br>
Count Ugolino, and th' Archbishop he<br>
Ruggieri. &nbsp;Why I neighbour him so close,<br>
Now list. &nbsp;That through effect of his ill thoughts<br>
In him my trust reposing, I was ta'en<br>
And after murder'd, need is not I tell.<br>
What therefore thou canst not have heard, that is,<br>
How cruel was the murder, shalt thou hear,<br>
And know if he have wrong'd me. &nbsp;A small grate<br>
Within that mew, which for my sake the name<br>
Of famine bears, where others yet must pine,<br>
Already through its opening sev'ral moons<br>
Had shown me, when I slept the evil sleep,<br>
That from the future tore the curtain off.<br>
This one, methought, as master of the sport,<br>
Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps<br>
Unto the mountain, which forbids the sight<br>
Of Lucca to the Pisan. &nbsp;With lean brachs<br>
Inquisitive and keen, before him rang'd<br>
Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi.<br>
After short course the father and the sons<br>
Seem'd tir'd and lagging, and methought I saw<br>
The sharp tusks gore their sides. &nbsp;When I awoke<br>
Before the dawn, amid their sleep I heard<br>
My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask<br>
For bread. &nbsp;Right cruel art thou, if no pang<br>
Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold;<br>
And if not now, why use thy tears to flow?<br>
Now had they waken'd; and the hour drew near<br>
When they were wont to bring us food; the mind<br>
Of each misgave him through his dream, and I<br>
Heard, at its outlet underneath lock'd up<br>
The' horrible tower: whence uttering not a word<br>
I look'd upon the visage of my sons.<br>
I wept not: so all stone I felt within.<br>
They wept: and one, my little Anslem, cried:<br>
'Thou lookest so! &nbsp;Father what ails thee?' &nbsp;Yet<br>
I shed no tear, nor answer'd all that day<br>
Nor the next night, until another sun<br>
Came out upon the world. &nbsp;When a faint beam<br>
Had to our doleful prison made its way,<br>
And in four countenances I descry'd<br>
The image of my own, on either hand<br>
Through agony I bit, and they who thought<br>
I did it through desire of feeding, rose<br>
O' th' sudden, and cried, 'Father, we should grieve<br>
Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav'st<br>
These weeds of miserable flesh we wear,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/33-313.jpg"><img alt="33-313b.jpg (43K)" src="images/33-313b.jpg" height="407" width="489"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


And do thou strip them off from us again.'<br>
Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down<br>
My spirit in stillness. &nbsp;That day and the next<br>
We all were silent. &nbsp;Ah, obdurate earth!<br>
Why open'dst not upon us? &nbsp;When we came<br>
To the fourth day, then Geddo at my feet<br>
Outstretch'd did fling him, crying, 'Hast no help<br>
For me, my father!' &nbsp;There he died, and e'en<br>
Plainly as thou seest me, saw I the three<br>
Fall one by one 'twixt the fifth day and sixth:<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/33-315.jpg"><img alt="33-315b.jpg (44K)" src="images/33-315b.jpg" height="405" width="492"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope<br>
Over them all, and for three days aloud<br>
Call'd on them who were dead. &nbsp;Then fasting got<br>
The mastery of grief." &nbsp;Thus having spoke,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/33-317.jpg"><img alt="33-317b.jpg (43K)" src="images/33-317b.jpg" height="400" width="490"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth<br>
He fasten'd, like a mastiff's 'gainst the bone<br>
Firm and unyielding. &nbsp;Oh thou Pisa! shame<br>
Of all the people, who their dwelling make<br>
In that fair region, where th' Italian voice<br>
Is heard, since that thy neighbours are so slack<br>
To punish, from their deep foundations rise<br>
Capraia and Gorgona, and dam up<br>
The mouth of Arno, that each soul in thee<br>
May perish in the waters! &nbsp;What if fame<br>
Reported that thy castles were betray'd<br>
By Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou<br>
To stretch his children on the rack. &nbsp;For them,<br>
Brigata, Ugaccione, and the pair<br>
Of gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,<br>
Their tender years, thou modern Thebes! did make<br>
Uncapable of guilt. &nbsp;Onward we pass'd,<br>
Where others skarf'd in rugged folds of ice<br>
Not on their feet were turn'd, but each revers'd.<br>
<br>There very weeping suffers not to weep;<br>
For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds<br>
Impediment, and rolling inward turns<br>
For increase of sharp anguish: the first tears<br>
Hang cluster'd, and like crystal vizors show,<br>
Under the socket brimming all the cup.<br>
<br>Now though the cold had from my face dislodg'd<br>
Each feeling, as 't were callous, yet me seem'd<br>
Some breath of wind I felt. &nbsp;"Whence cometh this,"<br>
Said I, "my master? &nbsp;Is not here below<br>
All vapour quench'd?"&mdash;"'Thou shalt be speedily,"<br>
He answer'd, "where thine eye shall tell thee whence<br>
The cause descrying of this airy shower."<br>
<br>Then cried out one in the chill crust who mourn'd:<br>
"O souls so cruel! that the farthest post<br>
Hath been assign'd you, from this face remove<br>
The harden'd veil, that I may vent the grief<br>
Impregnate at my heart, some little space<br>
Ere it congeal again!" &nbsp;I thus replied:<br>
"Say who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;<br>
And if I extricate thee not, far down<br>
As to the lowest ice may I descend!"<br>
<br>"The friar Alberigo," answered he,<br>
"Am I, who from the evil garden pluck'd<br>
Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date<br>
More luscious for my fig."&mdash;"Hah!" &nbsp;I exclaim'd,<br>
"Art thou too dead!"&mdash;"How in the world aloft<br>
It fareth with my body," answer'd he,<br>
"I am right ignorant. &nbsp;Such privilege<br>
Hath Ptolomea, that ofttimes the soul<br>
Drops hither, ere by Atropos divorc'd.<br>
And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly<br>
The glazed tear-drops that o'erlay mine eyes,<br>
Know that the soul, that moment she betrays,<br>
As I did, yields her body to a fiend<br>
Who after moves and governs it at will,<br>
Till all its time be rounded; headlong she<br>
Falls to this cistern. &nbsp;And perchance above<br>
Doth yet appear the body of a ghost,<br>
Who here behind me winters. &nbsp;Him thou know'st,<br>
If thou but newly art arriv'd below.<br>
The years are many that have pass'd away,<br>
Since to this fastness Branca Doria came."<br>
<br>"Now," answer'd I, "methinks thou mockest me,<br>
For Branca Doria never yet hath died,<br>
But doth all natural functions of a man,<br>
Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on."<br>
<br>He thus: "Not yet unto that upper foss<br>
By th' evil talons guarded, where the pitch<br>
Tenacious boils, had Michael Zanche reach'd,<br>
When this one left a demon in his stead<br>
In his own body, and of one his kin,<br>
Who with him treachery wrought. &nbsp;But now put forth<br>
Thy hand, and ope mine eyes." &nbsp;I op'd them not.<br>
Ill manners were best courtesy to him.<br>
<br>Ah Genoese! men perverse in every way,<br>
With every foulness stain'd, why from the earth<br>
Are ye not cancel'd? &nbsp;Such an one of yours<br>
I with Romagna's darkest spirit found,<br>
As for his doings even now in soul<br>
Is in Cocytus plung'd, and yet doth seem<br>
In body still alive upon the earth.</p>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XXXIV</h2>
<br>

<p>"THE banners of Hell's Monarch do come forth<br>
Towards us; therefore look," so spake my guide,<br>
"If thou discern him." &nbsp;As, when breathes a cloud<br>
Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night<br>
Fall on our hemisphere, seems view'd from far<br>
A windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round,<br>
Such was the fabric then methought I saw,<br>
<br>To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew<br>
Behind my guide: no covert else was there.<br>
<br>Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain<br>
Record the marvel) where the souls were all<br>
Whelm'd underneath, transparent, as through glass<br>
Pellucid the frail stem. &nbsp;Some prone were laid,<br>
Others stood upright, this upon the soles,<br>
That on his head, a third with face to feet<br>
Arch'd like a bow. &nbsp;When to the point we came,<br>
Whereat my guide was pleas'd that I should see<br>
The creature eminent in beauty once,<br>
He from before me stepp'd and made me pause.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/34-323.jpg"><img alt="34-323b.jpg (44K)" src="images/34-323b.jpg" height="404" width="490"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>"Lo!" &nbsp;he exclaim'd, "lo Dis! and lo the place,<br>
Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength."<br>
<br>How frozen and how faint I then became,<br>
Ask me not, reader! for I write it not,<br>
Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.<br>
I was not dead nor living. &nbsp;Think thyself<br>
If quick conception work in thee at all,<br>
How I did feel. &nbsp;That emperor, who sways<br>
The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th' ice<br>
Stood forth; and I in stature am more like<br>
A giant, than the giants are in his arms.<br>
Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits<br>
With such a part. &nbsp;If he were beautiful<br>
As he is hideous now, and yet did dare<br>
To scowl upon his Maker, well from him<br>
May all our mis'ry flow. &nbsp;Oh what a sight!<br>
How passing strange it seem'd, when I did spy<br>
Upon his head three faces: one in front<br>
Of hue vermilion, th' other two with this<br>
Midway each shoulder join'd and at the crest;<br>
The right 'twixt wan and yellow seem'd: the left<br>
To look on, such as come from whence old Nile<br>
Stoops to the lowlands. &nbsp;Under each shot forth<br>
Two mighty wings, enormous as became<br>
A bird so vast. &nbsp;Sails never such I saw<br>
Outstretch'd on the wide sea. &nbsp;No plumes had they,<br>
But were in texture like a bat, and these<br>
He flapp'd i' th' air, that from him issued still<br>
Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth<br>
Was frozen. &nbsp;At six eyes he wept: the tears<br>
Adown three chins distill'd with bloody foam.<br>
At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ'd<br>
Bruis'd as with pond'rous engine, so that three<br>
Were in this guise tormented. &nbsp;But far more<br>
Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang'd<br>
By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back<br>
Was stript of all its skin. &nbsp;"That upper spirit,<br>
Who hath worse punishment," so spake my guide,<br>
"Is Judas, he that hath his head within<br>
And plies the feet without. &nbsp;Of th' other two,<br>
Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw<br>
Who hangs, is Brutus: lo! how he doth writhe<br>
And speaks not! &nbsp;Th' other Cassius, that appears<br>
So large of limb. &nbsp;But night now re-ascends,<br>
And it is time for parting. &nbsp;All is seen."<br>
<br>I clipp'd him round the neck, for so he bade;<br>
And noting time and place, he, when the wings<br>
Enough were op'd, caught fast the shaggy sides,<br>
And down from pile to pile descending stepp'd<br>
Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.<br>
<br>Soon as he reach'd the point, whereat the thigh<br>
Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,<br>
My leader there with pain and struggling hard<br>
Turn'd round his head, where his feet stood before,<br>
And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,<br>
That into hell methought we turn'd again.<br>
<br>"Expect that by such stairs as these," thus spake<br>
The teacher, panting like a man forespent,<br>
"We must depart from evil so extreme."<br>
Then at a rocky opening issued forth,<br>
And plac'd me on a brink to sit, next join'd<br>
With wary step my side. &nbsp;I rais'd mine eyes,<br>
Believing that I Lucifer should see<br>
Where he was lately left, but saw him now<br>
With legs held upward. &nbsp;Let the grosser sort,<br>
Who see not what the point was I had pass'd,<br>
Bethink them if sore toil oppress'd me then.<br>
<br>"Arise," my master cried, "upon thy feet.<br>
The way is long, and much uncouth the road;<br>
And now within one hour and half of noon<br>
The sun returns." &nbsp;It was no palace-hall<br>
Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,<br>
But natural dungeon where ill footing was<br>
And scant supply of light. &nbsp;"Ere from th' abyss<br>
I sep'rate," thus when risen I began,<br>
"My guide! vouchsafe few words to set me free<br>
From error's thralldom. &nbsp;Where is now the ice?<br>
How standeth he in posture thus revers'd?<br>
And how from eve to morn in space so brief<br>
Hath the sun made his transit?" &nbsp;He in few<br>
Thus answering spake: "Thou deemest thou art still<br>
On th' other side the centre, where I grasp'd<br>
Th' abhorred worm, that boreth through the world.<br>
Thou wast on th' other side, so long as I<br>
Descended; when I turn'd, thou didst o'erpass<br>
That point, to which from ev'ry part is dragg'd<br>
All heavy substance. &nbsp;Thou art now arriv'd<br>
Under the hemisphere opposed to that,<br>
Which the great continent doth overspread,<br>
And underneath whose canopy expir'd<br>
The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv'd.<br>
Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,<br>
Whose other aspect is Judecca. &nbsp;Morn<br>
Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,<br>
Whose shaggy pile was scal'd, yet standeth fix'd,<br>
As at the first. &nbsp;On this part he fell down<br>
From heav'n; and th' earth, here prominent before,<br>
Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,<br>
And to our hemisphere retir'd. &nbsp;Perchance<br>
To shun him was the vacant space left here<br>
By what of firm land on this side appears,<br>
That sprang aloof." &nbsp;There is a place beneath,<br>
From Belzebub as distant, as extends<br>
The vaulted tomb, discover'd not by sight,<br>
But by the sound of brooklet, that descends<br>
This way along the hollow of a rock,<br>
Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,<br>
The wave hath eaten. &nbsp;By that hidden way<br>
My guide and I did enter, to return<br>
To the fair world: and heedless of repose<br>
We climbed, he first, I following his steps,<br>
Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav'n<br>
Dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave:<br>
Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.</p>
