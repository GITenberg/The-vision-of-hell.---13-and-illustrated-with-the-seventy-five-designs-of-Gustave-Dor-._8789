<h2>CANTO IX</h2>
<br>

<p>THE hue, which coward dread on my pale cheeks<br>
Imprinted, when I saw my guide turn back,<br>
Chas'd that from his which newly they had worn,<br>
And inwardly restrain'd it. &nbsp;He, as one<br>
Who listens, stood attentive: for his eye<br>
Not far could lead him through the sable air,<br>
And the thick-gath'ring cloud. &nbsp;"It yet behooves<br>
We win this fight"&mdash;thus he began&mdash;"if not&mdash;<br>
Such aid to us is offer'd.&mdash;Oh, how long<br>
Me seems it, ere the promis'd help arrive!"<br>
<br>I noted, how the sequel of his words<br>
Clok'd their beginning; for the last he spake<br>
Agreed not with the first. &nbsp;But not the less<br>
My fear was at his saying; sith I drew<br>
To import worse perchance, than that he held,<br>
His mutilated speech. &nbsp;"Doth ever any<br>
Into this rueful concave's extreme depth<br>
Descend, out of the first degree, whose pain<br>
Is deprivation merely of sweet hope?"<br>
<br>Thus I inquiring. "Rarely," he replied,<br>
"It chances, that among us any makes<br>
This journey, which I wend. &nbsp;Erewhile 'tis true<br>
Once came I here beneath, conjur'd by fell<br>
Erictho, sorceress, who compell'd the shades<br>
Back to their bodies. &nbsp;No long space my flesh<br>
Was naked of me, when within these walls<br>
She made me enter, to draw forth a spirit<br>
From out of Judas' circle. &nbsp;Lowest place<br>
Is that of all, obscurest, and remov'd<br>
Farthest from heav'n's all-circling orb. &nbsp;The road<br>
Full well I know: thou therefore rest secure.<br>
That lake, the noisome stench exhaling, round<br>
The city' of grief encompasses, which now<br>
We may not enter without rage." &nbsp;Yet more<br>
He added: but I hold it not in mind,<br>
For that mine eye toward the lofty tower<br>
Had drawn me wholly, to its burning top.<br>
Where in an instant I beheld uprisen<br>
At once three hellish furies stain'd with blood:<br>
In limb and motion feminine they seem'd;<br>
Around them greenest hydras twisting roll'd<br>
Their volumes; adders and cerastes crept<br>
Instead of hair, and their fierce temples bound.<br>
<br>He knowing well the miserable hags<br>
Who tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake:<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/09-097.jpg"><img alt="09-097b.jpg (45K)" src="images/09-097b.jpg" height="532" width="349"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

"Mark thou each dire Erinnys. To the left<br>
This is Megaera; on the right hand she,<br>
Who wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone<br>
I' th' midst." &nbsp;This said, in silence he remain'd<br>
Their breast they each one clawing tore; themselves<br>
Smote with their palms, and such shrill clamour rais'd,<br>
That to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound.<br>
"Hasten Medusa: so to adamant<br>
Him shall we change;" all looking down exclaim'd.<br>
"E'en when by Theseus' might assail'd, we took<br>
No ill revenge." &nbsp;"Turn thyself round, and keep<br>
Thy count'nance hid; for if the Gorgon dire<br>
Be shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return<br>
Upwards would be for ever lost." &nbsp;This said,<br>
Himself my gentle master turn'd me round,<br>
Nor trusted he my hands, but with his own<br>
He also hid me. &nbsp;Ye of intellect<br>
Sound and entire, mark well the lore conceal'd<br>
Under close texture of the mystic strain!<br>
<br>And now there came o'er the perturbed waves<br>
Loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made<br>
Either shore tremble, as if of a wind<br>
Impetuous, from conflicting vapours sprung,<br>
That 'gainst some forest driving all its might,<br>
Plucks off the branches, beats them down and hurls<br>
Afar; then onward passing proudly sweeps<br>
Its whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly.<br>
<br>Mine eyes he loos'd, and spake: "And now direct<br>
Thy visual nerve along that ancient foam,<br>
There, thickest where the smoke ascends." As frogs<br>
Before their foe the serpent, through the wave<br>
Ply swiftly all, till at the ground each one<br>
Lies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits<br>
Destroy'd, so saw I fleeing before one<br>
Who pass'd with unwet feet the Stygian sound.<br>
He, from his face removing the gross air,<br>
Oft his left hand forth stretch'd, and seem'd alone<br>
By that annoyance wearied. &nbsp;I perceiv'd<br>
That he was sent from heav'n, and to my guide<br>
Turn'd me, who signal made that I should stand<br>
Quiet, and bend to him. Ah me! how full<br>
Of noble anger seem'd he!  To the gate<br>
He came, and with his wand touch'd it, whereat<br>
Open without impediment it flew.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/09-101.jpg"><img alt="09-101b.jpg (52K)" src="images/09-101b.jpg" height="408" width="490"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<br>"Outcasts of heav'n!  O abject race and scorn'd!"<br>
Began he on the horrid grunsel standing,<br>
"Whence doth this wild excess of insolence<br>
Lodge in you? wherefore kick you 'gainst that will<br>
Ne'er frustrate of its end, and which so oft<br>
Hath laid on you enforcement of your pangs?<br>
What profits at the fays to but the horn?<br>
Your Cerberus, if ye remember, hence<br>
Bears still, peel'd of their hair, his throat and maw."<br>
<br>This said, he turn'd back o'er the filthy way,<br>
And syllable to us spake none, but wore<br>
The semblance of a man by other care<br>
Beset, and keenly press'd, than thought of him<br>
Who in his presence stands. &nbsp;Then we our steps<br>
Toward that territory mov'd, secure<br>
After the hallow'd words. &nbsp;We unoppos'd<br>
There enter'd; and my mind eager to learn<br>
What state a fortress like to that might hold,<br>
I soon as enter'd throw mine eye around,<br>
And see on every part wide-stretching space<br>
Replete with bitter pain and torment ill.<br>
<br>As where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles,<br>
Or as at Pola, near Quarnaro's gulf,<br>
That closes Italy and laves her bounds,<br>
The place is all thick spread with sepulchres;<br>
So was it here, save what in horror here<br>
Excell'd: for 'midst the graves were scattered flames,<br>
Wherewith intensely all throughout they burn'd,<br>
That iron for no craft there hotter needs.<br>
<br>Their lids all hung suspended, and beneath<br>
From them forth issu'd lamentable moans,<br>
Such as the sad and tortur'd well might raise.<br>
<br>I thus: "Master! say who are these, interr'd<br>
Within these vaults, of whom distinct we hear<br>
The dolorous sighs?" &nbsp;He answer thus return'd:<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/09-105.jpg"><img alt="09-105b.jpg (43K)" src="images/09-105b.jpg" height="551" width="360"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<br>"The arch-heretics are here, accompanied<br>
By every sect their followers; and much more,<br>
Than thou believest, tombs are freighted: like<br>
With like is buried; and the monuments<br>
Are different in degrees of heat." &nbsp;This said,<br>
He to the right hand turning, on we pass'd<br>
Betwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high.</p>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<h2>CANTO X</h2>
<br>

<p>NOW by a secret pathway we proceed,<br>
Between the walls, that hem the region round,<br>
And the tormented souls: my master first,<br>
I close behind his steps. &nbsp;"Virtue supreme!"<br>
I thus began; "who through these ample orbs<br>
In circuit lead'st me, even as thou will'st,<br>
Speak thou, and satisfy my wish. &nbsp;May those,<br>
Who lie within these sepulchres, be seen?<br>
Already all the lids are rais'd, and none<br>
O'er them keeps watch." &nbsp;He thus in answer spake<br>
"They shall be closed all, what-time they here<br>
From Josaphat return'd shall come, and bring<br>
Their bodies, which above they now have left.<br>
The cemetery on this part obtain<br>
With Epicurus all his followers,<br>
Who with the body make the spirit die.<br>
Here therefore satisfaction shall be soon<br>
Both to the question ask'd, and to the wish,<br>
Which thou conceal'st in silence." &nbsp;I replied:<br>
"I keep not, guide belov'd! from thee my heart<br>
Secreted, but to shun vain length of words,<br>
A lesson erewhile taught me by thyself."<br>
<br>"O Tuscan! thou who through the city of fire<br>
Alive art passing, so discreet of speech!<br>
Here please thee stay awhile. Thy utterance<br>
Declares the place of thy nativity<br>
To be that noble land, with which perchance<br>
I too severely dealt." &nbsp;Sudden that sound<br>
Forth issu'd from a vault, whereat in fear<br>
I somewhat closer to my leader's side<br>
Approaching, he thus spake: "What dost thou? &nbsp;Turn.<br>
Lo, Farinata, there! who hath himself<br>
Uplifted: from his girdle upwards all<br>
Expos'd behold him." &nbsp;On his face was mine<br>
Already fix'd; his breast and forehead there<br>
Erecting, seem'd as in high scorn he held<br>
E'en hell. &nbsp;Between the sepulchres to him<br>
My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt,<br>
This warning added: "See thy words be clear!"<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/10-109.jpg"><img alt="10-109b.jpg (42K)" src="images/10-109b.jpg" height="561" width="350"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>He, soon as there I stood at the tomb's foot,<br>
Ey'd me a space, then in disdainful mood<br>
Address'd me: "Say, what ancestors were thine?"<br>
<br>I, willing to obey him, straight reveal'd<br>
The whole, nor kept back aught: whence he, his brow<br>
Somewhat uplifting, cried: "Fiercely were they<br>
Adverse to me, my party, and the blood<br>
From whence I sprang: twice therefore I abroad<br>
Scatter'd them." &nbsp;"Though driv'n out, yet they each time<br>
From all parts," answer'd I, "return'd; an art<br>
Which yours have shown, they are not skill'd to learn."<br>
<br>Then, peering forth from the unclosed jaw,<br>
Rose from his side a shade, high as the chin,<br>
Leaning, methought, upon its knees uprais'd.<br>
It look'd around, as eager to explore<br>
If there were other with me; but perceiving<br>
That fond imagination quench'd, with tears<br>
Thus spake: "If thou through this blind prison go'st.<br>
Led by thy lofty genius and profound,<br>
Where is my son? and wherefore not with thee?"<br>
<br>I straight replied: "Not of myself I come,<br>
By him, who there expects me, through this clime<br>
Conducted, whom perchance Guido thy son<br>
Had in contempt." &nbsp;Already had his words<br>
And mode of punishment read me his name,<br>
Whence I so fully answer'd. &nbsp;He at once<br>
Exclaim'd, up starting, "How! said'st thou he HAD?<br>
No longer lives he? &nbsp;Strikes not on his eye<br>
The blessed daylight?" &nbsp;Then of some delay<br>
I made ere my reply aware, down fell<br>
Supine, not after forth appear'd he more.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the other, great of soul, near whom<br>
I yet was station'd, chang'd not count'nance stern,<br>
Nor mov'd the neck, nor bent his ribbed side.<br>
"And if," continuing the first discourse,<br>
"They in this art," he cried, "small skill have shown,<br>
That doth torment me more e'en than this bed.<br>
But not yet fifty times shall be relum'd<br>
Her aspect, who reigns here Queen of this realm,<br>
Ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art.<br>
So to the pleasant world mayst thou return,<br>
As thou shalt tell me, why in all their laws,<br>
Against my kin this people is so fell?"<br>
<br>"The slaughter and great havoc," I replied,<br>
"That colour'd Arbia's flood with crimson stain&mdash;<br>
To these impute, that in our hallow'd dome<br>
Such orisons ascend." &nbsp;Sighing he shook<br>
The head, then thus resum'd: "In that affray<br>
I stood not singly, nor without just cause<br>
Assuredly should with the rest have stirr'd;<br>
But singly there I stood, when by consent<br>
Of all, Florence had to the ground been raz'd,<br>
The one who openly forbad the deed."<br>
<br>"So may thy lineage find at last repose,"<br>
I thus adjur'd him, "as thou solve this knot,<br>
Which now involves my mind. &nbsp;If right I hear,<br>
Ye seem to view beforehand, that which time<br>
Leads with him, of the present uninform'd."<br>
<br>"We view, as one who hath an evil sight,"<br>
He answer'd, "plainly, objects far remote:<br>
So much of his large spendour yet imparts<br>
The' Almighty Ruler; but when they approach<br>
Or actually exist, our intellect<br>
Then wholly fails, nor of your human state<br>
Except what others bring us know we aught.<br>
Hence therefore mayst thou understand, that all<br>
Our knowledge in that instant shall expire,<br>
When on futurity the portals close."<br>
<br>Then conscious of my fault, and by remorse<br>
Smitten, I added thus: "Now shalt thou say<br>
To him there fallen, that his offspring still<br>
Is to the living join'd; and bid him know,<br>
That if from answer silent I abstain'd,<br>
'Twas that my thought was occupied intent<br>
Upon that error, which thy help hath solv'd."<br>
<br>But now my master summoning me back<br>
I heard, and with more eager haste besought<br>
The spirit to inform me, who with him<br>
Partook his lot. &nbsp;He answer thus return'd:<br>
<br>"More than a thousand with me here are laid<br>
Within is Frederick, second of that name,<br>
And the Lord Cardinal, and of the rest<br>
I speak not." &nbsp;He, this said, from sight withdrew.<br>
But I my steps towards the ancient bard<br>
Reverting, ruminated on the words<br>
Betokening me such ill. &nbsp;Onward he mov'd,<br>
And thus in going question'd: "Whence the' amaze<br>
That holds thy senses wrapt?" &nbsp;I satisfied<br>
The' inquiry, and the sage enjoin'd me straight:<br>
"Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard<br>
To thee importing harm; and note thou this,"<br>
With his rais'd finger bidding me take heed,<br>
<br>"When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam,<br>
Whose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life<br>
The future tenour will to thee unfold."<br>
<br>Forthwith he to the left hand turn'd his feet:<br>
We left the wall, and tow'rds the middle space<br>
Went by a path, that to a valley strikes;<br>
Which e'en thus high exhal'd its noisome steam.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="11"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XI</h2>
<br>

<p>UPON the utmost verge of a high bank,<br>
By craggy rocks environ'd round, we came,<br>
Where woes beneath more cruel yet were stow'd:<br>
And here to shun the horrible excess<br>
Of fetid exhalation, upward cast<br>
From the profound abyss, behind the lid<br>
Of a great monument we stood retir'd,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/11-115.jpg"><img alt="11-115b.jpg (52K)" src="images/11-115b.jpg" height="541" width="356"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Whereon this scroll I mark'd: "I have in charge<br>
Pope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew<br>
From the right path.&mdash;Ere our descent behooves<br>
We make delay, that somewhat first the sense,<br>
To the dire breath accustom'd, afterward<br>
Regard it not." &nbsp;My master thus; to whom<br>
Answering I spake: "Some compensation find<br>
That the time past not wholly lost." &nbsp;He then:<br>
"Lo! how my thoughts e'en to thy wishes tend!<br>
My son! within these rocks," he thus began,<br>
"Are three close circles in gradation plac'd,<br>
As these which now thou leav'st. Each one is full<br>
Of spirits accurs'd; but that the sight alone<br>
Hereafter may suffice thee, listen how<br>
And for what cause in durance they abide.<br>
<br>"Of all malicious act abhorr'd in heaven,<br>
The end is injury; and all such end<br>
Either by force or fraud works other's woe<br>
But fraud, because of man peculiar evil,<br>
To God is more displeasing; and beneath<br>
The fraudulent are therefore doom'd to' endure<br>
Severer pang. &nbsp;The violent occupy<br>
All the first circle; and because to force<br>
Three persons are obnoxious, in three rounds<br>
Hach within other sep'rate is it fram'd.<br>
To God, his neighbour, and himself, by man<br>
Force may be offer'd; to himself I say<br>
And his possessions, as thou soon shalt hear<br>
At full. &nbsp;Death, violent death, and painful wounds<br>
Upon his neighbour he inflicts; and wastes<br>
By devastation, pillage, and the flames,<br>
His substance. &nbsp;Slayers, and each one that smites<br>
In malice, plund'rers, and all robbers, hence<br>
The torment undergo of the first round<br>
In different herds. &nbsp;Man can do violence<br>
To himself and his own blessings: and for this<br>
He in the second round must aye deplore<br>
With unavailing penitence his crime,<br>
Whoe'er deprives himself of life and light,<br>
In reckless lavishment his talent wastes,<br>
And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy.<br>
To God may force be offer'd, in the heart<br>
Denying and blaspheming his high power,<br>
And nature with her kindly law contemning.<br>
And thence the inmost round marks with its seal<br>
Sodom and Cahors, and all such as speak<br>
Contemptuously' of the Godhead in their hearts.<br>
<br>"Fraud, that in every conscience leaves a sting,<br>
May be by man employ'd on one, whose trust<br>
He wins, or on another who withholds<br>
Strict confidence. &nbsp;Seems as the latter way<br>
Broke but the bond of love which Nature makes.<br>
Whence in the second circle have their nest<br>
Dissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries,<br>
Theft, falsehood, simony, all who seduce<br>
To lust, or set their honesty at pawn,<br>
With such vile scum as these. &nbsp;The other way<br>
Forgets both Nature's general love, and that<br>
Which thereto added afterwards gives birth<br>
To special faith. &nbsp;Whence in the lesser circle,<br>
Point of the universe, dread seat of Dis,<br>
The traitor is eternally consum'd."<br>
<br>I thus: "Instructor, clearly thy discourse<br>
Proceeds, distinguishing the hideous chasm<br>
And its inhabitants with skill exact.<br>
But tell me this: they of the dull, fat pool,<br>
Whom the rain beats, or whom the tempest drives,<br>
Or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet,<br>
Wherefore within the city fire-illum'd<br>
Are not these punish'd, if God's wrath be on them?<br>
And if it be not, wherefore in such guise<br>
Are they condemned?" &nbsp;He answer thus return'd:<br>
"Wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind,<br>
Not so accustom'd? or what other thoughts<br>
Possess it? &nbsp;Dwell not in thy memory<br>
The words, wherein thy ethic page describes<br>
Three dispositions adverse to Heav'n's will,<br>
Incont'nence, malice, and mad brutishness,<br>
And how incontinence the least offends<br>
God, and least guilt incurs? &nbsp;If well thou note<br>
This judgment, and remember who they are,<br>
Without these walls to vain repentance doom'd,<br>
Thou shalt discern why they apart are plac'd<br>
From these fell spirits, and less wreakful pours<br>
Justice divine on them its vengeance down."<br>
<br>"O Sun! who healest all imperfect sight,<br>
Thou so content'st me, when thou solv'st my doubt,<br>
That ignorance not less than knowledge charms.<br>
Yet somewhat turn thee back," I in these words<br>
Continu'd, "where thou saidst, that usury<br>
Offends celestial Goodness; and this knot<br>
Perplex'd unravel." &nbsp;He thus made reply:<br>
"Philosophy, to an attentive ear,<br>
Clearly points out, not in one part alone,<br>
How imitative nature takes her course<br>
From the celestial mind and from its art:<br>
And where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds,<br>
Not many leaves scann'd o'er, observing well<br>
Thou shalt discover, that your art on her<br>
Obsequious follows, as the learner treads<br>
In his instructor's step, so that your art<br>
Deserves the name of second in descent<br>
From God. &nbsp;These two, if thou recall to mind<br>
Creation's holy book, from the beginning<br>
Were the right source of life and excellence<br>
To human kind. &nbsp;But in another path<br>
The usurer walks; and Nature in herself<br>
And in her follower thus he sets at nought,<br>
Placing elsewhere his hope. &nbsp;But follow now<br>
My steps on forward journey bent; for now<br>
The Pisces play with undulating glance<br>
Along the' horizon, and the Wain lies all<br>
O'er the north-west; and onward there a space<br>
Is our steep passage down the rocky height."</p>

<h2>CANTO XII</h2>
<br>

<p>THE place where to descend the precipice<br>
We came, was rough as Alp, and on its verge<br>
Such object lay, as every eye would shun.<br>
<br>As is that ruin, which Adice's stream<br>
On this side Trento struck, should'ring the wave,<br>
Or loos'd by earthquake or for lack of prop;<br>
For from the mountain's summit, whence it mov'd<br>
To the low level, so the headlong rock<br>
Is shiver'd, that some passage it might give<br>
To him who from above would pass; e'en such<br>
Into the chasm was that descent: and there<br>
At point of the disparted ridge lay stretch'd<br>
The infamy of Crete, detested brood<br>
Of the feign'd heifer: and at sight of us<br>
It gnaw'd itself, as one with rage distract.<br>

To him my guide exclaim'd: "Perchance thou deem'st<br>
The King of Athens here, who, in the world<br>
Above, thy death contriv'd. &nbsp;Monster! avaunt!<br>
He comes not tutor'd by thy sister's art,<br>
But to behold your torments is he come."<br>
<br>Like to a bull, that with impetuous spring<br>
Darts, at the moment when the fatal blow<br>
Hath struck him, but unable to proceed<br>
Plunges on either side; so saw I plunge<br>
The Minotaur; whereat the sage exclaim'd:<br>
"Run to the passage! while he storms, 't is well<br>
That thou descend." &nbsp;Thus down our road we took<br>
Through those dilapidated crags, that oft<br>
Mov'd underneath my feet, to weight like theirs<br>
Unus'd. &nbsp;I pond'ring went, and thus he spake:<br>
<br>"Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruin'd steep,<br>
Guarded by the brute violence, which I<br>
Have vanquish'd now. Know then, that when I erst<br>
Hither descended to the nether hell,<br>
This rock was not yet fallen. &nbsp;But past doubt<br>
(If well I mark) not long ere He arrived,<br>
Who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil<br>
Of the highest circle, then through all its bounds<br>
Such trembling seiz'd the deep concave and foul,<br>
I thought the universe was thrill'd with love,<br>
Whereby, there are who deem, the world hath oft<br>
Been into chaos turn'd: and in that point,<br>
Here, and elsewhere, that old rock toppled down.<br>
But fix thine eyes beneath: the river of blood<br>
Approaches, in the which all those are steep'd,<br>
Who have by violence injur'd." &nbsp;O blind lust!<br>
O foolish wrath! who so dost goad us on<br>
In the brief life, and in the eternal then<br>
Thus miserably o'erwhelm us. &nbsp;I beheld<br>
An ample foss, that in a bow was bent,<br>
As circling all the plain; for so my guide<br>
Had told. &nbsp;Between it and the rampart's base<br>
On trail ran Centaurs, with keen arrows arm'd,<br>
As to the chase they on the earth were wont.<br>

<br><br><br><br>


<br>At seeing us descend they each one stood;<br>
And issuing from the troop, three sped with bows<br>
And missile weapons chosen first; of whom<br>
One cried from far: "Say to what pain ye come<br>
Condemn'd, who down this steep have journied? &nbsp;Speak<br>
From whence ye stand, or else the bow I draw."<br>
<br>To whom my guide: "Our answer shall be made<br>
To Chiron, there, when nearer him we come.<br>
Ill was thy mind, thus ever quick and rash."<br>
<br>Then me he touch'd, and spake: "Nessus is this,<br>
Who for the fair Deianira died,<br>
And wrought himself revenge for his own fate.<br>
He in the midst, that on his breast looks down,<br>
Is the great Chiron who Achilles nurs'd;<br>
That other Pholus, prone to wrath." &nbsp;Around<br>
The foss these go by thousands, aiming shafts<br>
At whatsoever spirit dares emerge<br>
From out the blood, more than his guilt allows.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/12-129.jpg"><img alt="12-129b.jpg (48K)" src="images/12-129b.jpg" height="403" width="493"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>We to those beasts, that rapid strode along,<br>
Drew near, when Chiron took an arrow forth,<br>
And with the notch push'd back his shaggy beard<br>
To the cheek-bone, then his great mouth to view<br>
Exposing, to his fellows thus exclaim'd:<br>
"Are ye aware, that he who comes behind<br>
Moves what he touches? &nbsp;The feet of the dead<br>
Are not so wont." &nbsp;My trusty guide, who now<br>
Stood near his breast, where the two natures join,<br>
Thus made reply: "He is indeed alive,<br>
And solitary so must needs by me<br>
Be shown the gloomy vale, thereto induc'd<br>
By strict necessity, not by delight.<br>
She left her joyful harpings in the sky,<br>
Who this new office to my care consign'd.<br>
He is no robber, no dark spirit I.<br>
But by that virtue, which empowers my step<br>
To treat so wild a path, grant us, I pray,<br>
One of thy band, whom we may trust secure,<br>
Who to the ford may lead us, and convey<br>
Across, him mounted on his back; for he<br>
Is not a spirit that may walk the air."<br>
<br>Then on his right breast turning, Chiron thus<br>
To Nessus spake: "Return, and be their guide.<br>
And if ye chance to cross another troop,<br>
Command them keep aloof." &nbsp;Onward we mov'd,<br>
The faithful escort by our side, along<br>
The border of the crimson-seething flood,<br>
Whence from those steep'd within loud shrieks arose.<br>
<br>Some there I mark'd, as high as to their brow<br>
Immers'd, of whom the mighty Centaur thus:<br>
"These are the souls of tyrants, who were given<br>
To blood and rapine. &nbsp;Here they wail aloud<br>
Their merciless wrongs. &nbsp;Here Alexander dwells,<br>
And Dionysius fell, who many a year<br>
Of woe wrought for fair Sicily. &nbsp;That brow<br>
Whereon the hair so jetty clust'ring hangs,<br>
Is Azzolino; that with flaxen locks<br>
Obizzo' of Este, in the world destroy'd<br>
By his foul step-son." &nbsp;To the bard rever'd<br>
I turned me round, and thus he spake; "Let him<br>
Be to thee now first leader, me but next<br>
To him in rank." &nbsp;Then farther on a space<br>
The Centaur paus'd, near some, who at the throat<br>
Were extant from the wave; and showing us<br>
A spirit by itself apart retir'd,<br>
Exclaim'd: "He in God's bosom smote the heart,<br>
Which yet is honour'd on the bank of Thames."<br>
<br>A race I next espied, who held the head,<br>
And even all the bust above the stream.<br>
'Midst these I many a face remember'd well.<br>
Thus shallow more and more the blood became,<br>
So that at last it but imbru'd the feet;<br>
And there our passage lay athwart the foss.<br>
<br>"As ever on this side the boiling wave<br>
Thou seest diminishing," the Centaur said,<br>
"So on the other, be thou well assur'd,<br>
It lower still and lower sinks its bed,<br>
Till in that part it reuniting join,<br>
Where 't is the lot of tyranny to mourn.<br>
There Heav'n's stern justice lays chastising hand<br>
On Attila, who was the scourge of earth,<br>
On Sextus, and on Pyrrhus, and extracts<br>
Tears ever by the seething flood unlock'd<br>
From the Rinieri, of Corneto this,<br>
Pazzo the other nam'd, who fill'd the ways<br>
With violence and war." &nbsp;This said, he turn'd,<br>
And quitting us, alone repass'd the ford.</p>
