<h2>CANTO III</h2>
<br>

<p>"THROUGH me you pass into the city of woe:<br>
Through me you pass into eternal pain:<br>
Through me among the people lost for aye.<br>
Justice the founder of my fabric mov'd:<br>
To rear me was the task of power divine,<br>
Supremest wisdom, and primeval love.<br>
Before me things create were none, save things<br>
Eternal, and eternal I endure.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/03-027.jpg"><img alt="03-027b.jpg (40K)" src="images/03-027b.jpg" height="383" width="489"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

"All hope abandon ye who enter here."<br>
<br>Such characters in colour dim I mark'd<br>
Over a portal's lofty arch inscrib'd:<br>
Whereat I thus: "Master, these words import<br>
Hard meaning." &nbsp;He as one prepar'd replied:<br>
"Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave;<br>
Here be vile fear extinguish'd. We are come<br>
Where I have told thee we shall see the souls<br>
To misery doom'd, who intellectual good<br>
Have lost." &nbsp;And when his hand he had stretch'd forth<br>
To mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer'd,<br>
Into that secret place he led me on.<br>
<br>Here sighs with lamentations and loud moans<br>
Resounded through the air pierc'd by no star,<br>
That e'en I wept at entering. &nbsp;Various tongues,<br>
Horrible languages, outcries of woe,<br>
Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,<br>
With hands together smote that swell'd the sounds,<br>
Made up a tumult, that for ever whirls<br>
Round through that air with solid darkness stain'd,<br>
Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.<br>
<br>I then, with error yet encompass'd, cried:<br>
"O master! &nbsp;What is this I hear? &nbsp;What race<br>
Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?"<br>
<br>He thus to me: "This miserable fate<br>
Suffer the wretched souls of those, who liv'd<br>
Without or praise or blame, with that ill band<br>
Of angels mix'd, who nor rebellious prov'd<br>
Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves<br>
Were only. &nbsp;From his bounds Heaven drove them forth,<br>
Not to impair his lustre, nor the depth<br>
Of Hell receives them, lest th' accursed tribe<br>
Should glory thence with exultation vain."<br>
<br>I then: "Master! what doth aggrieve them thus,<br>
That they lament so loud?" &nbsp;He straight replied:<br>
"That will I tell thee briefly. &nbsp;These of death<br>
No hope may entertain: and their blind life<br>
So meanly passes, that all other lots<br>
They envy. &nbsp;Fame of them the world hath none,<br>
Nor suffers; mercy and justice scorn them both.<br>
Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by."<br>
<br>And I, who straightway look'd, beheld a flag,<br>
Which whirling ran around so rapidly,<br>
That it no pause obtain'd: and following came<br>
Such a long train of spirits, I should ne'er<br>
Have thought, that death so many had despoil'd.<br>
<br>When some of these I recogniz'd, I saw<br>
And knew the shade of him, who to base fear<br>
Yielding, abjur'd his high estate. &nbsp;Forthwith<br>
I understood for certain this the tribe<br>
Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing<br>
And to his foes. &nbsp;These wretches, who ne'er lived,<br>
Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung<br>
By wasps and hornets, which bedew'd their cheeks<br>
With blood, that mix'd with tears dropp'd to their feet,<br>
And by disgustful worms was gather'd there.<br>
<br>Then looking farther onwards I beheld<br>
A throng upon the shore of a great stream:<br>
Whereat I thus: "Sir! grant me now to know<br>
Whom here we view, and whence impell'd they seem<br>
So eager to pass o'er, as I discern<br>
Through the blear light?" &nbsp;He thus to me in few:<br>
"This shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive<br>
Beside the woeful tide of Acheron."<br>
<br>Then with eyes downward cast and fill'd with shame,<br>
Fearing my words offensive to his ear,<br>
Till we had reach'd the river, I from speech<br>
Abstain'd. &nbsp;And lo! toward us in a bark<br>
Comes on an old man hoary white with eld,<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/03-031.jpg"><img alt="03-031b.jpg (47K)" src="images/03-031b.jpg" height="548" width="351"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

Crying, "Woe to you wicked spirits! hope not<br>
Ever to see the sky again. &nbsp;I come<br>
To take you to the other shore across,<br>
Into eternal darkness, there to dwell<br>
In fierce heat and in ice. &nbsp;And thou, who there<br>
Standest, live spirit! get thee hence, and leave<br>
These who are dead." &nbsp;But soon as he beheld<br>
I left them not, "By other way," said he,<br>
"By other haven shalt thou come to shore,<br>
Not by this passage; thee a nimbler boat<br>
Must carry." &nbsp;Then to him thus spake my guide:<br>
"Charon! thyself torment not: so 't is will'd,<br>
Where will and power are one: ask thou no more."<br>
<br>Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks<br>
Of him the boatman o'er the livid lake,<br>
Around whose eyes glar'd wheeling flames. &nbsp;Meanwhile<br>
Those spirits, faint and naked, color chang'd,<br>
And gnash'd their teeth, soon as the cruel words<br>
They heard. &nbsp;God and their parents they blasphem'd,<br>
The human kind, the place, the time, and seed<br>
That did engender them and give them birth.<br>
<br>Then all together sorely wailing drew<br>
To the curs'd strand, that every man must pass<br>
Who fears not God. &nbsp;Charon, demoniac form,<br>
With eyes of burning coal, collects them all,<br>
Beck'ning, and each, that lingers, with his oar<br>
Strikes. &nbsp;As fall off the light autumnal leaves,<br>
One still another following, till the bough<br>
Strews all its honours on the earth beneath;<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/03-035.jpg"><img alt="03-035b.jpg (49K)" src="images/03-035b.jpg" height="399" width="492"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

E'en in like manner Adam's evil brood<br>
Cast themselves one by one down from the shore,<br>
Each at a beck, as falcon at his call.<br>
<br>Thus go they over through the umber'd wave,<br>
And ever they on the opposing bank<br>
Be landed, on this side another throng<br>
Still gathers. &nbsp;"Son," thus spake the courteous guide,<br>
"Those, who die subject to the wrath of God,<br>
All here together come from every clime,<br>
And to o'erpass the river are not loth:<br>
For so heaven's justice goads them on, that fear<br>
Is turn'd into desire. &nbsp;Hence ne'er hath past<br>
Good spirit. &nbsp;If of thee Charon complain,<br>
Now mayst thou know the import of his words."<br>
<br>This said, the gloomy region trembling shook<br>
So terribly, that yet with clammy dews<br>
Fear chills my brow. &nbsp;The sad earth gave a blast,<br>
That, lightening, shot forth a vermilion flame,<br>
Which all my senses conquer'd quite, and I<br>
Down dropp'd, as one with sudden slumber seiz'd.</p>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<h2>CANTO IV</h2>
<br>

<p>BROKE the deep slumber in my brain a crash<br>
Of heavy thunder, that I shook myself,<br>
As one by main force rous'd. &nbsp;Risen upright,<br>
My rested eyes I mov'd around, and search'd<br>
With fixed ken to know what place it was,<br>
Wherein I stood. &nbsp;For certain on the brink<br>
I found me of the lamentable vale,<br>
The dread abyss, that joins a thund'rous sound<br>
Of plaints innumerable. &nbsp;Dark and deep,<br>
And thick with clouds o'erspread, mine eye in vain<br>
Explor'd its bottom, nor could aught discern.<br>
<br>"Now let us to the blind world there beneath<br>
Descend;" the bard began all pale of look:<br>
"I go the first, and thou shalt follow next."<br>
<br>Then I his alter'd hue perceiving, thus:<br>
"How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread,<br>
Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt?"<br>
<br>He then: "The anguish of that race below<br>
With pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear<br>
Mistakest. &nbsp;Let us on. &nbsp;Our length of way<br>
Urges to haste." &nbsp;Onward, this said, he mov'd;<br>
And ent'ring led me with him on the bounds<br>
Of the first circle, that surrounds th' abyss.<br>
Here, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard<br>
Except of sighs, that made th' eternal air<br>
Tremble, not caus'd by tortures, but from grief<br>
Felt by those multitudes, many and vast,<br>
Of men, women, and infants. &nbsp;Then to me<br>
The gentle guide: "Inquir'st thou not what spirits<br>
Are these, which thou beholdest? &nbsp;Ere thou pass<br>
Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin<br>
Were blameless; and if aught they merited,<br>
It profits not, since baptism was not theirs,<br>
The portal to thy faith. &nbsp;If they before<br>
The Gospel liv'd, they serv'd not God aright;<br>
And among such am I. For these defects,<br>
And for no other evil, we are lost;<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/04-039.jpg"><img alt="04-039b.jpg (56K)" src="images/04-039b.jpg" height="392" width="492"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

"Only so far afflicted, that we live<br>
Desiring without hope." &nbsp;So grief assail'd<br>
My heart at hearing this, for well I knew<br>
Suspended in that Limbo many a soul<br>
Of mighty worth. &nbsp;"O tell me, sire rever'd!<br>
Tell me, my master!" &nbsp;I began through wish<br>
Of full assurance in that holy faith,<br>
Which vanquishes all error; "say, did e'er<br>
Any, or through his own or other's merit,<br>
Come forth from thence, whom afterward was blest?"<br>
<br>Piercing the secret purport of my speech,<br>
He answer'd: "I was new to that estate,<br>
When I beheld a puissant one arrive<br>
Amongst us, with victorious trophy crown'd.<br>
He forth the shade of our first parent drew,<br>
Abel his child, and Noah righteous man,<br>
Of Moses lawgiver for faith approv'd,<br>
Of patriarch Abraham, and David king,<br>
Israel with his sire and with his sons,<br>
Nor without Rachel whom so hard he won,<br>
And others many more, whom he to bliss<br>
Exalted. &nbsp;Before these, be thou assur'd,<br>
No spirit of human kind was ever sav'd."<br>
<br>We, while he spake, ceas'd not our onward road,<br>
Still passing through the wood; for so I name<br>
Those spirits thick beset. &nbsp;We were not far<br>
On this side from the summit, when I kenn'd<br>
A flame, that o'er the darken'd hemisphere<br>
Prevailing shin'd. &nbsp;Yet we a little space<br>
Were distant, not so far but I in part<br>
Discover'd, that a tribe in honour high<br>
That place possess'd. &nbsp;"O thou, who every art<br>
And science valu'st! who are these, that boast<br>
Such honour, separate from all the rest?"<br>
<br>He answer'd: "The renown of their great names<br>
That echoes through your world above, acquires<br>
Favour in heaven, which holds them thus advanc'd."<br>
Meantime a voice I heard: "Honour the bard<br>
Sublime! his shade returns that left us late!"<br>
No sooner ceas'd the sound, than I beheld<br>
Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps,<br>
Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad.<br>
<br>When thus my master kind began: "Mark him,<br>
Who in his right hand bears that falchion keen,<br>
The other three preceding, as their lord.<br>
This is that Homer, of all bards supreme:<br>
Flaccus the next in satire's vein excelling;<br>
The third is Naso; Lucan is the last.<br>
Because they all that appellation own,<br>
With which the voice singly accosted me,<br>
Honouring they greet me thus, and well they judge."<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/04-043.jpg"><img alt="04-043b.jpg (52K)" src="images/04-043b.jpg" height="544" width="357"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<br>So I beheld united the bright school<br>
Of him the monarch of sublimest song,<br>
That o'er the others like an eagle soars.<br>
When they together short discourse had held,<br>
They turn'd to me, with salutation kind<br>
Beck'ning me; at the which my master smil'd:<br>
Nor was this all; but greater honour still<br>
They gave me, for they made me of their tribe;<br>
And I was sixth amid so learn'd a band.<br>
<br>Far as the luminous beacon on we pass'd<br>
Speaking of matters, then befitting well<br>
To speak, now fitter left untold. &nbsp;At foot<br>
Of a magnificent castle we arriv'd,<br>
Seven times with lofty walls begirt, and round<br>
Defended by a pleasant stream. &nbsp;O'er this<br>
As o'er dry land we pass'd. &nbsp;Next through seven gates<br>
I with those sages enter'd, and we came<br>
Into a mead with lively verdure fresh.<br>
<br>There dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around<br>
Majestically mov'd, and in their port<br>
Bore eminent authority; they spake<br>
Seldom, but all their words were tuneful sweet.<br>
<br>We to one side retir'd, into a place<br>
Open and bright and lofty, whence each one<br>
Stood manifest to view. &nbsp;Incontinent<br>
There on the green enamel of the plain<br>
Were shown me the great spirits, by whose sight<br>
I am exalted in my own esteem.<br>
<br>Electra there I saw accompanied<br>
By many, among whom Hector I knew,<br>
Anchises' pious son, and with hawk's eye<br>
Caesar all arm'd, and by Camilla there<br>
Penthesilea. &nbsp;On the other side<br>
Old King Latinus, seated by his child<br>
Lavinia, and that Brutus I beheld,<br>
Who Tarquin chas'd, Lucretia, Cato's wife<br>
Marcia, with Julia and Cornelia there;<br>
And sole apart retir'd, the Soldan fierce.<br>
<br>Then when a little more I rais'd my brow,<br>
I spied the master of the sapient throng,<br>
Seated amid the philosophic train.<br>
Him all admire, all pay him rev'rence due.<br>
There Socrates and Plato both I mark'd,<br>
Nearest to him in rank; Democritus,<br>
Who sets the world at chance, Diogenes,<br>
With Heraclitus, and Empedocles,<br>
And Anaxagoras, and Thales sage,<br>
Zeno, and Dioscorides well read<br>
In nature's secret lore. &nbsp;Orpheus I mark'd<br>
And Linus, Tully and moral Seneca,<br>
Euclid and Ptolemy, Hippocrates,<br>
Galenus, Avicen, and him who made<br>
That commentary vast, Averroes.<br>
<br>Of all to speak at full were vain attempt;<br>
For my wide theme so urges, that ofttimes<br>
My words fall short of what bechanc'd. &nbsp;In two<br>
The six associates part. &nbsp;Another way<br>
My sage guide leads me, from that air serene,<br>
Into a climate ever vex'd with storms:<br>
And to a part I come where no light shines.</p>
