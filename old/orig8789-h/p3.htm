<h2>CANTO V</h2>
<br>


<p>FROM the first circle I descended thus<br>
Down to the second, which, a lesser space<br>
Embracing, so much more of grief contains<br>
Provoking bitter moans. &nbsp;There, Minos stands<br>
Grinning with ghastly feature: he, of all<br>
Who enter, strict examining the crimes,<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/05-047.jpg"><img alt="05-047b.jpg (46K)" src="images/05-047b.jpg" height="393" width="494"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

Gives sentence, and dismisses them beneath,<br>
According as he foldeth him around:<br>
For when before him comes th' ill fated soul,<br>
It all confesses; and that judge severe<br>
Of sins, considering what place in hell<br>
Suits the transgression, with his tail so oft<br>
Himself encircles, as degrees beneath<br>
He dooms it to descend. &nbsp;Before him stand<br>
Always a num'rous throng; and in his turn<br>
Each one to judgment passing, speaks, and hears<br>
His fate, thence downward to his dwelling hurl'd.<br>
<br>"O thou! who to this residence of woe<br>
Approachest?" &nbsp;when he saw me coming, cried<br>
Minos, relinquishing his dread employ,<br>
"Look how thou enter here; beware in whom<br>
Thou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad<br>
Deceive thee to thy harm." &nbsp;To him my guide:<br>
"Wherefore exclaimest? &nbsp;Hinder not his way<br>
By destiny appointed; so 'tis will'd<br>
Where will and power are one. &nbsp;Ask thou no more."<br>
<br>Now 'gin the rueful wailings to be heard.<br>
Now am I come where many a plaining voice<br>
Smites on mine ear. &nbsp;Into a place I came<br>
Where light was silent all. &nbsp;Bellowing there groan'd<br>
A noise as of a sea in tempest torn<br>
By warring winds. &nbsp;The stormy blast of hell<br>
With restless fury drives the spirits on<br>
Whirl'd round and dash'd amain with sore annoy.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/05-051.jpg"><img alt="05-051b.jpg (45K)" src="images/05-051b.jpg" height="540" width="358"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

When they arrive before the ruinous sweep,<br>
There shrieks are heard, there lamentations, moans,<br>
And blasphemies 'gainst the good Power in heaven.<br>
<br>I understood that to this torment sad<br>
The carnal sinners are condemn'd, in whom<br>
Reason by lust is sway'd. &nbsp;As in large troops<br>
And multitudinous, when winter reigns,<br>
The starlings on their wings are borne abroad;<br>
So bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls.<br>
On this side and on that, above, below,<br>
It drives them: hope of rest to solace them<br>
Is none, nor e'en of milder pang. &nbsp;As cranes,<br>
Chanting their dol'rous notes, traverse the sky,<br>
Stretch'd out in long array: so I beheld<br>
Spirits, who came loud wailing, hurried on<br>
By their dire doom. &nbsp;Then I: "Instructor! who<br>
Are these, by the black air so scourg'd?"&mdash;"The first<br>
'Mong those, of whom thou question'st," he replied,<br>
"O'er many tongues was empress. &nbsp;She in vice<br>
Of luxury was so shameless, that she made<br>
Liking be lawful by promulg'd decree,<br>
To clear the blame she had herself incurr'd.<br>
This is Semiramis, of whom 'tis writ,<br>
That she succeeded Ninus her espous'd;<br>
And held the land, which now the Soldan rules.<br>
The next in amorous fury slew herself,<br>
And to Sicheus' ashes broke her faith:<br>
Then follows Cleopatra, lustful queen."<br>
<br>There mark'd I Helen, for whose sake so long<br>
The time was fraught with evil; there the great<br>
Achilles, who with love fought to the end.<br>
Paris I saw, and Tristan; and beside<br>
A thousand more he show'd me, and by name<br>
Pointed them out, whom love bereav'd of life.<br>
<br>When I had heard my sage instructor name<br>
Those dames and knights of antique days, o'erpower'd<br>
By pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind<br>
Was lost; and I began: "Bard! willingly<br>
I would address those two together coming,<br>
Which seem so light before the wind." &nbsp;He thus:<br>
"Note thou, when nearer they to us approach.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/05-053.jpg"><img alt="05-053b.jpg (44K)" src="images/05-053b.jpg" height="542" width="352"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

"Then by that love which carries them along,<br>
Entreat; and they will come." &nbsp;Soon as the wind<br>
Sway'd them toward us, I thus fram'd my speech:<br>
"O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse<br>
With us, if by none else restrain'd." &nbsp;As doves<br>
By fond desire invited, on wide wings<br>
And firm, to their sweet nest returning home,<br>
Cleave the air, wafted by their will along;<br>
Thus issu'd from that troop, where Dido ranks,<br>
They through the ill air speeding; with such force<br>
My cry prevail'd by strong affection urg'd.<br>
<br>"O gracious creature and benign! who go'st<br>
Visiting, through this element obscure,<br>
Us, who the world with bloody stain imbru'd;<br>
If for a friend the King of all we own'd,<br>
Our pray'r to him should for thy peace arise,<br>
Since thou hast pity on our evil plight.<br>
()f whatsoe'er to hear or to discourse<br>
It pleases thee, that will we hear, of that<br>
Freely with thee discourse, while e'er the wind,<br>
As now, is mute. &nbsp;The land, that gave me birth,<br>
Is situate on the coast, where Po descends<br>
To rest in ocean with his sequent streams.<br>
<br>"Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt,<br>
Entangled him by that fair form, from me<br>
Ta'en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still:<br>
Love, that denial takes from none belov'd,<br>
Caught me with pleasing him so passing well,<br>
That, as thou see'st, he yet deserts me not.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/05-057.jpg"><img alt="05-057b.jpg (48K)" src="images/05-057b.jpg" height="401" width="489"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

"Love brought us to one death: Caina waits<br>
The soul, who spilt our life." &nbsp;Such were their words;<br>
At hearing which downward I bent my looks,<br>
And held them there so long, that the bard cried:<br>
"What art thou pond'ring?" &nbsp;I in answer thus:<br>
"Alas! by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire<br>
Must they at length to that ill pass have reach'd!"<br>
<br>Then turning, I to them my speech address'd.<br>
And thus began: "Francesca! your sad fate<br>
Even to tears my grief and pity moves.<br>
But tell me; in the time of your sweet sighs,<br>
By what, and how love granted, that ye knew<br>
Your yet uncertain wishes?" &nbsp;She replied:<br>
"No greater grief than to remember days<br>
Of joy, when mis'ry is at hand!  That kens<br>
Thy learn'd instructor. &nbsp;Yet so eagerly<br>
If thou art bent to know the primal root,<br>
From whence our love gat being, I will do,<br>
As one, who weeps and tells his tale. &nbsp;One day<br>
For our delight we read of Lancelot,<br>
How him love thrall'd. &nbsp;Alone we were, and no<br>
Suspicion near us. &nbsp;Ofttimes by that reading<br>
Our eyes were drawn together, and the hue<br>
Fled from our alter'd cheek. &nbsp;But at one point<br>
Alone we fell. &nbsp;When of that smile we read,<br>
The wished smile, rapturously kiss'd<br>
By one so deep in love, then he, who ne'er<br>
From me shall separate, at once my lips<br>
All trembling kiss'd. &nbsp;The book and writer both<br>
Were love's purveyors. &nbsp;In its leaves that day<br>
We read no more." &nbsp;While thus one spirit spake,<br>
The other wail'd so sorely, that heartstruck<br>
I through compassion fainting, seem'd not far<br>
From death, and like a corpse fell to the ground.</p>

<h2>CANTO VI</h2>
<br>

<p>MY sense reviving, that erewhile had droop'd<br>
With pity for the kindred shades, whence grief<br>
O'ercame me wholly, straight around I see<br>
New torments, new tormented souls, which way<br>
Soe'er I move, or turn, or bend my sight.<br>
In the third circle I arrive, of show'rs<br>
Ceaseless, accursed, heavy, and cold, unchang'd<br>
For ever, both in kind and in degree.<br>
Large hail, discolour'd water, sleety flaw<br>
Through the dun midnight air stream'd down amain:<br>
Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell.<br>
<br>Cerberus, cruel monster, fierce and strange,<br>
Through his wide threefold throat barks as a dog<br>
Over the multitude immers'd beneath.<br>
His eyes glare crimson, black his unctuous beard,<br>
His belly large, and claw'd the hands, with which<br>
He tears the spirits, flays them, and their limbs<br>
Piecemeal disparts. &nbsp;Howling there spread, as curs,<br>
Under the rainy deluge, with one side<br>
The other screening, oft they roll them round,<br>
A wretched, godless crew. &nbsp;When that great worm<br>
Descried us, savage Cerberus, he op'd<br>
His jaws, and the fangs show'd us; not a limb<br>
Of him but trembled. &nbsp;Then my guide, his palms<br>
Expanding on the ground, thence filled with earth<br>
Rais'd them, and cast it in his ravenous maw.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/06-067.jpg"><img alt="06-067b.jpg (47K)" src="images/06-067b.jpg" height="401" width="495"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

E'en as a dog, that yelling bays for food<br>
His keeper, when the morsel comes, lets fall<br>
His fury, bent alone with eager haste<br>
To swallow it; so dropp'd the loathsome cheeks<br>
Of demon Cerberus, who thund'ring stuns<br>
The spirits, that they for deafness wish in vain.<br>
<br>We, o'er the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt<br>
Of the heavy tempest passing, set our feet<br>
Upon their emptiness, that substance seem'd.<br>
<br>They all along the earth extended lay<br>
Save one, that sudden rais'd himself to sit,<br>
Soon as that way he saw us pass. &nbsp;"O thou!"<br>
He cried, "who through the infernal shades art led,<br>
Own, if again thou know'st me. &nbsp;Thou wast fram'd<br>
Or ere my frame was broken." &nbsp;I replied:<br>
"The anguish thou endur'st perchance so takes<br>
Thy form from my remembrance, that it seems<br>
As if I saw thee never. &nbsp;But inform<br>
Me who thou art, that in a place so sad<br>
Art set, and in such torment, that although<br>
Other be greater, more disgustful none<br>
Can be imagin'd." &nbsp;He in answer thus:<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/06-069.jpg"><img alt="06-069b.jpg (52K)" src="images/06-069b.jpg" height="415" width="493"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

"Thy city heap'd with envy to the brim,<br>
Ay that the measure overflows its bounds,<br>
Held me in brighter days. &nbsp;Ye citizens<br>
Were wont to name me Ciacco. &nbsp;For the sin<br>
Of glutt'ny, damned vice, beneath this rain,<br>
E'en as thou see'st, I with fatigue am worn;<br>
Nor I sole spirit in this woe: all these<br>
Have by like crime incurr'd like punishment."<br>
<br>No more he said, and I my speech resum'd:<br>
"Ciacco! thy dire affliction grieves me much,<br>
Even to tears. &nbsp;But tell me, if thou know'st,<br>
What shall at length befall the citizens<br>
Of the divided city; whether any just one<br>
Inhabit there: and tell me of the cause,<br>
Whence jarring discord hath assail'd it thus?"<br>
<br>He then: "After long striving they will come<br>
To blood; and the wild party from the woods<br>
Will chase the other with much injury forth.<br>
Then it behoves, that this must fall, within<br>
Three solar circles; and the other rise<br>
By borrow'd force of one, who under shore<br>
Now rests. &nbsp;It shall a long space hold aloof<br>
Its forehead, keeping under heavy weight<br>
The other oppress'd, indignant at the load,<br>
And grieving sore. &nbsp;The just are two in number,<br>
But they neglected. &nbsp;Av'rice, envy, pride,<br>
Three fatal sparks, have set the hearts of all<br>
On fire." &nbsp;Here ceas'd the lamentable sound;<br>
And I continu'd thus: "Still would I learn<br>
More from thee, farther parley still entreat.<br>
Of Farinata and Tegghiaio say,<br>
They who so well deserv'd, of Giacopo,<br>
Arrigo, Mosca, and the rest, who bent<br>
Their minds on working good. &nbsp;Oh! tell me where<br>
They bide, and to their knowledge let me come.<br>
For I am press'd with keen desire to hear,<br>
If heaven's sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell<br>
Be to their lip assign'd." &nbsp;&nbsp;He answer'd straight:<br>
"These are yet blacker spirits. &nbsp;Various crimes<br>
Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss.<br>
If thou so far descendest, thou mayst see them.<br>
But to the pleasant world when thou return'st,<br>
Of me make mention, I entreat thee, there.<br>
No more I tell thee, answer thee no more."<br>
<br>This said, his fixed eyes he turn'd askance,<br>
A little ey'd me, then bent down his head,<br>
And 'midst his blind companions with it fell.<br>
<br>When thus my guide: "No more his bed he leaves,<br>
Ere the last angel-trumpet blow. &nbsp;The Power<br>
Adverse to these shall then in glory come,<br>
Each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair,<br>
Resume his fleshly vesture and his form,<br>
And hear the eternal doom re-echoing rend<br>
The vault." &nbsp;So pass'd we through that mixture foul<br>
Of spirits and rain, with tardy steps; meanwhile<br>
Touching, though slightly, on the life to come.<br>
For thus I question'd: "Shall these tortures, Sir!<br>
When the great sentence passes, be increas'd,<br>
Or mitigated, or as now severe?"<br>
<br>He then: "Consult thy knowledge; that decides<br>
That as each thing to more perfection grows,<br>
It feels more sensibly both good and pain.<br>
Though ne'er to true perfection may arrive<br>
This race accurs'd, yet nearer then than now<br>
They shall approach it." &nbsp;Compassing that path<br>
Circuitous we journeyed, and discourse<br>
Much more than I relate between us pass'd:<br>
Till at the point, where the steps led below,<br>
Arriv'd, there Plutus, the great foe, we found.</p>
