<h2>CANTO XIII</h2>
<br>

<p>ERE Nessus yet had reach'd the other bank,<br>
We enter'd on a forest, where no track<br>
Of steps had worn a way. &nbsp;Not verdant there<br>
The foliage, but of dusky hue; not light<br>
The boughs and tapering, but with knares deform'd<br>
And matted thick: fruits there were none, but thorns<br>
Instead, with venom fill'd. Less sharp than these,<br>
Less intricate the brakes, wherein abide<br>
Those animals, that hate the cultur'd fields,<br>
Betwixt Corneto and Cecina's stream.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/13-135.jpg"><img alt="13-135b.jpg (50K)" src="images/13-135b.jpg" height="533" width="353"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>Here the brute Harpies make their nest, the same<br>
Who from the Strophades the Trojan band<br>
Drove with dire boding of their future woe.<br>
Broad are their pennons, of the human form<br>
Their neck and count'nance, arm'd with talons keen<br>
The feet, and the huge belly fledge with wings<br>
These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood.<br>
<br>The kind instructor in these words began:<br>
"Ere farther thou proceed, know thou art now<br>
I' th' second round, and shalt be, till thou come<br>
Upon the horrid sand: look therefore well<br>
Around thee, and such things thou shalt behold,<br>
As would my speech discredit." &nbsp;On all sides<br>
I heard sad plainings breathe, and none could see<br>
From whom they might have issu'd. &nbsp;In amaze<br>
Fast bound I stood. &nbsp;He, as it seem'd, believ'd,<br>
That I had thought so many voices came<br>
From some amid those thickets close conceal'd,<br>
And thus his speech resum'd: "If thou lop off<br>
A single twig from one of those ill plants,<br>
The thought thou hast conceiv'd shall vanish quite."<br>
<br>Thereat a little stretching forth my hand,<br>
From a great wilding gather'd I a branch,<br>
And straight the trunk exclaim'd: "Why pluck'st thou me?"<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/13-137.jpg"><img alt="13-137b.jpg (52K)" src="images/13-137b.jpg" height="397" width="487"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Then as the dark blood trickled down its side,<br>
These words it added: "Wherefore tear'st me thus?<br>
Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast?<br>
Men once were we, that now are rooted here.<br>
Thy hand might well have spar'd us, had we been<br>
The souls of serpents." &nbsp;As a brand yet green,<br>
That burning at one end from the' other sends<br>
A groaning sound, and hisses with the wind<br>
That forces out its way, so burst at once,<br>
Forth from the broken splinter words and blood.<br>
<br>I, letting fall the bough, remain'd as one<br>
Assail'd by terror, and the sage replied:<br>
"If he, O injur'd spirit! could have believ'd<br>
What he hath seen but in my verse describ'd,<br>
He never against thee had stretch'd his hand.<br>
But I, because the thing surpass'd belief,<br>
Prompted him to this deed, which even now<br>
Myself I rue. &nbsp;But tell me, who thou wast;<br>
That, for this wrong to do thee some amends,<br>
In the upper world (for thither to return<br>
Is granted him) thy fame he may revive."<br>
<br>"That pleasant word of thine," the trunk replied<br>
"Hath so inveigled me, that I from speech<br>
Cannot refrain, wherein if I indulge<br>
A little longer, in the snare detain'd,<br>
Count it not grievous. &nbsp;I it was, who held<br>
Both keys to Frederick's heart, and turn'd the wards,<br>
Opening and shutting, with a skill so sweet,<br>
That besides me, into his inmost breast<br>
Scarce any other could admittance find.<br>
The faith I bore to my high charge was such,<br>
It cost me the life-blood that warm'd my veins.<br>
The harlot, who ne'er turn'd her gloating eyes<br>
From Caesar's household, common vice and pest<br>
Of courts, 'gainst me inflam'd the minds of all;<br>
And to Augustus they so spread the flame,<br>
That my glad honours chang'd to bitter woes.<br>
My soul, disdainful and disgusted, sought<br>
Refuge in death from scorn, and I became,<br>
Just as I was, unjust toward myself.<br>
By the new roots, which fix this stem, I swear,<br>
That never faith I broke to my liege lord,<br>
Who merited such honour; and of you,<br>
If any to the world indeed return,<br>
Clear he from wrong my memory, that lies<br>
Yet prostrate under envy's cruel blow."<br>
<br>First somewhat pausing, till the mournful words<br>
Were ended, then to me the bard began:<br>
"Lose not the time; but speak and of him ask,<br>
If more thou wish to learn." &nbsp;Whence I replied:<br>
"Question thou him again of whatsoe'er<br>
Will, as thou think'st, content me; for no power<br>
Have I to ask, such pity' is at my heart."<br>
<br>He thus resum'd; "So may he do for thee<br>
Freely what thou entreatest, as thou yet<br>
Be pleas'd, imprison'd Spirit! to declare,<br>
How in these gnarled joints the soul is tied;<br>
And whether any ever from such frame<br>
Be loosen'd, if thou canst, that also tell."<br>
<br>Thereat the trunk breath'd hard, and the wind soon<br>
Chang'd into sounds articulate like these;<br>
<br>Briefly ye shall be answer'd. &nbsp;"When departs<br>
The fierce soul from the body, by itself<br>
Thence torn asunder, to the seventh gulf<br>
By Minos doom'd, into the wood it falls,<br>
No place assign'd, but wheresoever chance<br>
Hurls it, there sprouting, as a grain of spelt,<br>
It rises to a sapling, growing thence<br>
A savage plant. &nbsp;The Harpies, on its leaves<br>
Then feeding, cause both pain and for the pain<br>
A vent to grief. &nbsp;We, as the rest, shall come<br>
For our own spoils, yet not so that with them<br>
We may again be clad; for what a man<br>
Takes from himself it is not just he have.<br>
Here we perforce shall drag them; and throughout<br>
The dismal glade our bodies shall be hung,<br>
Each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade."<br>
<br>Attentive yet to listen to the trunk<br>
We stood, expecting farther speech, when us<br>
A noise surpris'd, as when a man perceives<br>
The wild boar and the hunt approach his place<br>
Of station'd watch, who of the beasts and boughs<br>
Loud rustling round him hears. &nbsp;And lo! there came<br>
Two naked, torn with briers, in headlong flight,<br>
That they before them broke each fan o' th' wood.<br>
"Haste now," the foremost cried, "now haste thee death!"<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/13-143.jpg"><img alt="13-143b.jpg (66K)" src="images/13-143b.jpg" height="394" width="494"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


The' other, as seem'd, impatient of delay<br>
Exclaiming, "Lano! not so bent for speed<br>
Thy sinews, in the lists of Toppo's field."<br>
And then, for that perchance no longer breath<br>
Suffic'd him, of himself and of a bush<br>
One group he made. &nbsp;Behind them was the wood<br>
Full of black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet,<br>
As greyhounds that have newly slipp'd the leash.<br>
On him, who squatted down, they stuck their fangs,<br>
And having rent him piecemeal bore away<br>
The tortur'd limbs. &nbsp;My guide then seiz'd my hand,<br>
And led me to the thicket, which in vain<br>
Mourn'd through its bleeding wounds: "O Giacomo<br>
Of Sant' Andrea! what avails it thee,"<br>
It cried, "that of me thou hast made thy screen?<br>
For thy ill life what blame on me recoils?"<br>
<br>When o'er it he had paus'd, my master spake:<br>
"Say who wast thou, that at so many points<br>
Breath'st out with blood thy lamentable speech?"<br>
<br>He answer'd: "Oh, ye spirits: arriv'd in time<br>
To spy the shameful havoc, that from me<br>
My leaves hath sever'd thus, gather them up,<br>
And at the foot of their sad parent-tree<br>
Carefully lay them. &nbsp;In that city' I dwelt,<br>
Who for the Baptist her first patron chang'd,<br>
Whence he for this shall cease not with his art<br>
To work her woe: and if there still remain'd not<br>
On Arno's passage some faint glimpse of him,<br>
Those citizens, who rear'd once more her walls<br>
Upon the ashes left by Attila,<br>
Had labour'd without profit of their toil.<br>
I slung the fatal noose from my own roof."</p>

<h2>CANTO XIV</h2>
<br>

<p>SOON as the charity of native land<br>
Wrought in my bosom, I the scatter'd leaves<br>
Collected, and to him restor'd, who now<br>
Was hoarse with utt'rance. &nbsp;To the limit thence<br>
We came, which from the third the second round<br>
Divides, and where of justice is display'd<br>
Contrivance horrible. &nbsp;Things then first seen<br>
Clearlier to manifest, I tell how next<br>
A plain we reach'd, that from its sterile bed<br>
Each plant repell'd. The mournful wood waves round<br>
Its garland on all sides, as round the wood<br>
Spreads the sad foss. &nbsp;There, on the very edge,<br>
Our steps we stay'd. &nbsp;It was an area wide<br>
Of arid sand and thick, resembling most<br>
The soil that erst by Cato's foot was trod.<br>
<br>Vengeance of Heav'n! Oh! how shouldst thou be fear'd<br>
By all, who read what here my eyes beheld!<br>
<br>Of naked spirits many a flock I saw,<br>
All weeping piteously, to different laws<br>
Subjected: for on the' earth some lay supine,<br>
Some crouching close were seated, others pac'd<br>
Incessantly around; the latter tribe,<br>
More numerous, those fewer who beneath<br>
The torment lay, but louder in their grief.<br>
<br>O'er all the sand fell slowly wafting down<br>
Dilated flakes of fire, as flakes of snow<br>
On Alpine summit, when the wind is hush'd.<br>
As in the torrid Indian clime, the son<br>
Of Ammon saw upon his warrior band<br>
Descending, solid flames, that to the ground<br>
Came down: whence he bethought him with his troop<br>
To trample on the soil; for easier thus<br>
The vapour was extinguish'd, while alone;<br>
So fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith<br>
The marble glow'd underneath, as under stove<br>
The viands, doubly to augment the pain.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/14-147.jpg"><img alt="14-147b.jpg (53K)" src="images/14-147b.jpg" height="414" width="497"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Unceasing was the play of wretched hands,<br>
Now this, now that way glancing, to shake off<br>
The heat, still falling fresh. &nbsp;I thus began:<br>
"Instructor! thou who all things overcom'st,<br>
Except the hardy demons, that rush'd forth<br>
To stop our entrance at the gate, say who<br>
Is yon huge spirit, that, as seems, heeds not<br>
The burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn,<br>
As by the sultry tempest immatur'd?"<br>
<br>Straight he himself, who was aware I ask'd<br>
My guide of him, exclaim'd: "Such as I was<br>
When living, dead such now I am. &nbsp;If Jove<br>
Weary his workman out, from whom in ire<br>
He snatch'd the lightnings, that at my last day<br>
Transfix'd me, if the rest be weary out<br>
At their black smithy labouring by turns<br>
In Mongibello, while he cries aloud;<br>
"Help, help, good Mulciber!" as erst he cried<br>
In the Phlegraean warfare, and the bolts<br>
Launch he full aim'd at me with all his might,<br>
He never should enjoy a sweet revenge."<br>
<br>Then thus my guide, in accent higher rais'd<br>
Than I before had heard him: "Capaneus!<br>
Thou art more punish'd, in that this thy pride<br>
Lives yet unquench'd: no torrent, save thy rage,<br>
Were to thy fury pain proportion'd full."<br>
<br>Next turning round to me with milder lip<br>
He spake: "This of the seven kings was one,<br>
Who girt the Theban walls with siege, and held,<br>
As still he seems to hold, God in disdain,<br>
And sets his high omnipotence at nought.<br>
But, as I told him, his despiteful mood<br>
Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it.<br>
Follow me now; and look thou set not yet<br>
Thy foot in the hot sand, but to the wood<br>
Keep ever close." &nbsp;Silently on we pass'd<br>
To where there gushes from the forest's bound<br>
A little brook, whose crimson'd wave yet lifts<br>
My hair with horror. &nbsp;As the rill, that runs<br>
From Bulicame, to be portion'd out<br>
Among the sinful women; so ran this<br>
Down through the sand, its bottom and each bank<br>
Stone-built, and either margin at its side,<br>
Whereon I straight perceiv'd our passage lay.<br>
<br>"Of all that I have shown thee, since that gate<br>
We enter'd first, whose threshold is to none<br>
Denied, nought else so worthy of regard,<br>
As is this river, has thine eye discern'd,<br>
O'er which the flaming volley all is quench'd."<br>
<br>So spake my guide; and I him thence besought,<br>
That having giv'n me appetite to know,<br>
The food he too would give, that hunger crav'd.<br>
<br>"In midst of ocean," forthwith he began,<br>
"A desolate country lies, which Crete is nam'd,<br>
Under whose monarch in old times the world<br>
Liv'd pure and chaste. &nbsp;A mountain rises there,<br>
Call'd Ida, joyous once with leaves and streams,<br>
Deserted now like a forbidden thing.<br>
It was the spot which Rhea, Saturn's spouse,<br>
Chose for the secret cradle of her son;<br>
And better to conceal him, drown'd in shouts<br>
His infant cries. &nbsp;Within the mount, upright<br>
An ancient form there stands and huge, that turns<br>
His shoulders towards Damiata, and at Rome<br>
As in his mirror looks. &nbsp;Of finest gold<br>
His head is shap'd, pure silver are the breast<br>
And arms; thence to the middle is of brass.<br>
And downward all beneath well-temper'd steel,<br>
Save the right foot of potter's clay, on which<br>
Than on the other more erect he stands,<br>
Each part except the gold, is rent throughout;<br>
And from the fissure tears distil, which join'd<br>
Penetrate to that cave. &nbsp;They in their course<br>
Thus far precipitated down the rock<br>
Form Acheron, and Styx, and Phlegethon;<br>
Then by this straiten'd channel passing hence<br>
Beneath, e'en to the lowest depth of all,<br>
Form there Cocytus, of whose lake (thyself<br>
Shall see it) I here give thee no account."<br>
<br>Then I to him: "If from our world this sluice<br>
Be thus deriv'd; wherefore to us but now<br>
Appears it at this edge?" &nbsp;He straight replied:<br>
"The place, thou know'st, is round; and though great part<br>
Thou have already pass'd, still to the left<br>
Descending to the nethermost, not yet<br>
Hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb.<br>
Wherefore if aught of new to us appear,<br>
It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks."<br>
<br>Then I again inquir'd: "Where flow the streams<br>
Of Phlegethon and Lethe? for of one<br>
Thou tell'st not, and the other of that shower,<br>
Thou say'st, is form'd." &nbsp;He answer thus return'd:<br>
"Doubtless thy questions all well pleas'd I hear.<br>
Yet the red seething wave might have resolv'd<br>
One thou proposest. &nbsp;Lethe thou shalt see,<br>
But not within this hollow, in the place,<br>
Whither to lave themselves the spirits go,<br>
Whose blame hath been by penitence remov'd."<br>
He added: "Time is now we quit the wood.<br>
Look thou my steps pursue: the margins give<br>
Safe passage, unimpeded by the flames;<br>
For over them all vapour is extinct."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="15"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XV</h2>
<br>

<p>One of the solid margins bears us now<br>
Envelop'd in the mist, that from the stream<br>
Arising, hovers o'er, and saves from fire<br>
Both piers and water. &nbsp;As the Flemings rear<br>
Their mound, 'twixt Ghent and Bruges, to chase back<br>
The ocean, fearing his tumultuous tide<br>
That drives toward them, or the Paduans theirs<br>
Along the Brenta, to defend their towns<br>
And castles, ere the genial warmth be felt<br>
On Chiarentana's top; such were the mounds,<br>
So fram'd, though not in height or bulk to these<br>
Made equal, by the master, whosoe'er<br>
He was, that rais'd them here. &nbsp;We from the wood<br>
Were not so far remov'd, that turning round<br>
I might not have discern'd it, when we met<br>
A troop of spirits, who came beside the pier.<br>
<br>They each one ey'd us, as at eventide<br>
One eyes another under a new moon,<br>
And toward us sharpen'd their sight as keen,<br>
As an old tailor at his needle's eye.<br>
<br>Thus narrowly explor'd by all the tribe,<br>
I was agniz'd of one, who by the skirt<br>
Caught me, and cried, "What wonder have we here!"<br>
<br>And I, when he to me outstretch'd his arm,<br>
Intently fix'd my ken on his parch'd looks,<br>
That although smirch'd with fire, they hinder'd not<br>
But I remember'd him; and towards his face<br>
My hand inclining, answer'd: "Sir! Brunetto!<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/15-155.jpg"><img alt="15-155b.jpg (49K)" src="images/15-155b.jpg" height="405" width="493"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


"And art thou here?" &nbsp;He thus to me: "My son!<br>
Oh let it not displease thee, if Brunetto<br>
Latini but a little space with thee<br>
Turn back, and leave his fellows to proceed."<br>
<br>I thus to him replied: "Much as I can,<br>
I thereto pray thee; and if thou be willing,<br>
That I here seat me with thee, I consent;<br>
His leave, with whom I journey, first obtain'd."<br>
<br>"O son!" said he, "whoever of this throng<br>
One instant stops, lies then a hundred years,<br>
No fan to ventilate him, when the fire<br>
Smites sorest. &nbsp;Pass thou therefore on. &nbsp;I close<br>
Will at thy garments walk, and then rejoin<br>
My troop, who go mourning their endless doom."<br>
<br>I dar'd not from the path descend to tread<br>
On equal ground with him, but held my head<br>
Bent down, as one who walks in reverent guise.<br>
<br>"What chance or destiny," thus he began,<br>
"Ere the last day conducts thee here below?<br>
And who is this, that shows to thee the way?"<br>
<br>"There up aloft," I answer'd, "in the life<br>
Serene, I wander'd in a valley lost,<br>
Before mine age had to its fullness reach'd.<br>
But yester-morn I left it: then once more<br>
Into that vale returning, him I met;<br>
And by this path homeward he leads me back."<br>
<br>"If thou," he answer'd, "follow but thy star,<br>
Thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven:<br>
Unless in fairer days my judgment err'd.<br>
And if my fate so early had not chanc'd,<br>
Seeing the heav'ns thus bounteous to thee, I<br>
Had gladly giv'n thee comfort in thy work.<br>
But that ungrateful and malignant race,<br>
Who in old times came down from Fesole,<br>
Ay and still smack of their rough mountain-flint,<br>
Will for thy good deeds shew thee enmity.<br>
Nor wonder; for amongst ill-savour'd crabs<br>
It suits not the sweet fig-tree lay her fruit.<br>
Old fame reports them in the world for blind,<br>
Covetous, envious, proud. &nbsp;Look to it well:<br>
Take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways. &nbsp;For thee<br>
Thy fortune hath such honour in reserve,<br>
That thou by either party shalt be crav'd<br>
With hunger keen: but be the fresh herb far<br>
From the goat's tooth. &nbsp;The herd of Fesole<br>
May of themselves make litter, not touch the plant,<br>
If any such yet spring on their rank bed,<br>
In which the holy seed revives, transmitted<br>
From those true Romans, who still there remain'd,<br>
When it was made the nest of so much ill."<br>
<br>"Were all my wish fulfill'd," I straight replied,<br>
"Thou from the confines of man's nature yet<br>
Hadst not been driven forth; for in my mind<br>
Is fix'd, and now strikes full upon my heart<br>
The dear, benign, paternal image, such<br>
As thine was, when so lately thou didst teach me<br>
The way for man to win eternity;<br>
And how I priz'd the lesson, it behooves,<br>
That, long as life endures, my tongue should speak,<br>
What of my fate thou tell'st, that write I down:<br>
And with another text to comment on<br>
For her I keep it, the celestial dame,<br>
Who will know all, if I to her arrive.<br>
This only would I have thee clearly note:<br>
That so my conscience have no plea against me;<br>
Do fortune as she list, I stand prepar'd.<br>
Not new or strange such earnest to mine ear.<br>
Speed fortune then her wheel, as likes her best,<br>
The clown his mattock; all things have their course."<br>
<br>Thereat my sapient guide upon his right<br>
Turn'd himself back, then look'd at me and spake:<br>
"He listens to good purpose who takes note."<br>
<br>I not the less still on my way proceed,<br>
Discoursing with Brunetto, and inquire<br>
Who are most known and chief among his tribe.<br>
<br>"To know of some is well;" thus he replied,<br>
"But of the rest silence may best beseem.<br>
Time would not serve us for report so long.<br>
In brief I tell thee, that all these were clerks,<br>
Men of great learning and no less renown,<br>
By one same sin polluted in the world.<br>
With them is Priscian, and Accorso's son<br>
Francesco herds among that wretched throng:<br>
And, if the wish of so impure a blotch<br>
Possess'd thee, him thou also might'st have seen,<br>
Who by the servants' servant was transferr'd<br>
From Arno's seat to Bacchiglione, where<br>
His ill-strain'd nerves he left. &nbsp;I more would add,<br>
But must from farther speech and onward way<br>
Alike desist, for yonder I behold<br>
A mist new-risen on the sandy plain.<br>
A company, with whom I may not sort,<br>
Approaches. &nbsp;I commend my TREASURE to thee,<br>
Wherein I yet survive; my sole request."<br>
<br>This said he turn'd, and seem'd as one of those,<br>
Who o'er Verona's champain try their speed<br>
For the green mantle, and of them he seem'd,<br>
Not he who loses but who gains the prize.</p>

<h2>CANTO XVI</h2>
<br>

<p>NOW came I where the water's din was heard,<br>
As down it fell into the other round,<br>
Resounding like the hum of swarming bees:<br>
When forth together issu'd from a troop,<br>
That pass'd beneath the fierce tormenting storm,<br>
Three spirits, running swift. &nbsp;They towards us came,<br>
And each one cried aloud, "Oh do thou stay!<br>
Whom by the fashion of thy garb we deem<br>
To be some inmate of our evil land."<br>
<br>Ah me! what wounds I mark'd upon their limbs,<br>
Recent and old, inflicted by the flames!<br>
E'en the remembrance of them grieves me yet.<br>
<br>Attentive to their cry my teacher paus'd,<br>
And turn'd to me his visage, and then spake;<br>
"Wait now! our courtesy these merit well:<br>
And were 't not for the nature of the place,<br>
Whence glide the fiery darts, I should have said,<br>
That haste had better suited thee than them."<br>
<br>They, when we stopp'd, resum'd their ancient wail,<br>
And soon as they had reach'd us, all the three<br>
Whirl'd round together in one restless wheel.<br>
As naked champions, smear'd with slippery oil,<br>
Are wont intent to watch their place of hold<br>
And vantage, ere in closer strife they meet;<br>
Thus each one, as he wheel'd, his countenance<br>
At me directed, so that opposite<br>
The neck mov'd ever to the twinkling feet.<br>
<br>"If misery of this drear wilderness,"<br>
Thus one began, "added to our sad cheer<br>
And destitute, do call forth scorn on us<br>
And our entreaties, let our great renown<br>
Incline thee to inform us who thou art,<br>
That dost imprint with living feet unharm'd<br>
The soil of Hell. &nbsp;He, in whose track thou see'st<br>
My steps pursuing, naked though he be<br>
And reft of all, was of more high estate<br>
Than thou believest; grandchild of the chaste<br>
Gualdrada, him they Guidoguerra call'd,<br>
Who in his lifetime many a noble act<br>
Achiev'd, both by his wisdom and his sword.<br>
The other, next to me that beats the sand,<br>
Is Aldobrandi, name deserving well,<br>
In the' upper world, of honour; and myself<br>
Who in this torment do partake with them,<br>
Am Rusticucci, whom, past doubt, my wife<br>
Of savage temper, more than aught beside<br>
Hath to this evil brought." &nbsp;If from the fire<br>
I had been shelter'd, down amidst them straight<br>
I then had cast me, nor my guide, I deem,<br>
Would have restrain'd my going; but that fear<br>
Of the dire burning vanquish'd the desire,<br>
Which made me eager of their wish'd embrace.<br>
<br>I then began: "Not scorn, but grief much more,<br>
Such as long time alone can cure, your doom<br>
Fix'd deep within me, soon as this my lord<br>
Spake words, whose tenour taught me to expect<br>
That such a race, as ye are, was at hand.<br>
I am a countryman of yours, who still<br>
Affectionate have utter'd, and have heard<br>
Your deeds and names renown'd. &nbsp;Leaving the gall<br>
For the sweet fruit I go, that a sure guide<br>
Hath promis'd to me. &nbsp;But behooves, that far<br>
As to the centre first I downward tend."<br>
<br>"So may long space thy spirit guide thy limbs,"<br>
He answer straight return'd; "and so thy fame<br>
Shine bright, when thou art gone; as thou shalt tell,<br>
If courtesy and valour, as they wont,<br>
Dwell in our city, or have vanish'd clean?<br>
For one amidst us late condemn'd to wail,<br>
Borsiere, yonder walking with his peers,<br>
Grieves us no little by the news he brings."<br>
<br>"An upstart multitude and sudden gains,<br>
Pride and excess, O Florence! have in thee<br>
Engender'd, so that now in tears thou mourn'st!"<br>
Thus cried I with my face uprais'd, and they<br>
All three, who for an answer took my words,<br>
Look'd at each other, as men look when truth<br>
Comes to their ear. &nbsp;"If thou at other times,"<br>
They all at once rejoin'd, "so easily<br>
Satisfy those, who question, happy thou,<br>
Gifted with words, so apt to speak thy thought!<br>
Wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime,<br>
Returning to behold the radiant stars,<br>
When thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past,<br>
See that of us thou speak among mankind."<br>
<br>This said, they broke the circle, and so swift<br>
Fled, that as pinions seem'd their nimble feet.<br>
<br>Not in so short a time might one have said<br>
"Amen," as they had vanish'd. Straight my guide<br>
Pursu'd his track. &nbsp;I follow'd; and small space<br>
Had we pass'd onward, when the water's sound<br>
Was now so near at hand, that we had scarce<br>
Heard one another's speech for the loud din.<br>
<br>E'en as the river, that holds on its course<br>
Unmingled, from the mount of Vesulo,<br>
On the left side of Apennine, toward<br>
The east, which Acquacheta higher up<br>
They call, ere it descend into the vale,<br>
At Forli by that name no longer known,<br>
Rebellows o'er Saint Benedict, roll'd on<br>
From the' Alpine summit down a precipice,<br>
Where space enough to lodge a thousand spreads;<br>
Thus downward from a craggy steep we found,<br>
That this dark wave resounded, roaring loud,<br>
So that the ear its clamour soon had stunn'd.<br>
<br>I had a cord that brac'd my girdle round,<br>
Wherewith I erst had thought fast bound to take<br>
The painted leopard. &nbsp;This when I had all<br>
Unloosen'd from me (so my master bade)<br>
I gather'd up, and stretch'd it forth to him.<br>
Then to the right he turn'd, and from the brink<br>
Standing few paces distant, cast it down<br>
Into the deep abyss. &nbsp;"And somewhat strange,"<br>
Thus to myself I spake, "signal so strange<br>
Betokens, which my guide with earnest eye<br>
Thus follows." &nbsp;Ah! what caution must men use<br>
With those who look not at the deed alone,<br>
But spy into the thoughts with subtle skill!<br>
<br>"Quickly shall come," he said, "what I expect,<br>
Thine eye discover quickly, that whereof<br>
Thy thought is dreaming." &nbsp;Ever to that truth,<br>
Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears,<br>
A man, if possible, should bar his lip;<br>
Since, although blameless, he incurs reproach.<br>
But silence here were vain; and by these notes<br>
Which now I sing, reader! I swear to thee,<br>
So may they favour find to latest times!<br>
That through the gross and murky air I spied<br>
A shape come swimming up, that might have quell'd<br>
The stoutest heart with wonder, in such guise<br>
As one returns, who hath been down to loose<br>
An anchor grappled fast against some rock,<br>
Or to aught else that in the salt wave lies,<br>
Who upward springing close draws in his feet.</p>

<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XVII</h2>
<br>

<p>"LO! the fell monster with the deadly sting!<br>
Who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls<br>
And firm embattled spears, and with his filth<br>
Taints all the world!" &nbsp;Thus me my guide address'd,<br>
And beckon'd him, that he should come to shore,<br>
Near to the stony causeway's utmost edge.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/17-167.jpg"><img alt="17-167b.jpg (50K)" src="images/17-167b.jpg" height="531" width="357"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear'd,<br>
His head and upper part expos'd on land,<br>
But laid not on the shore his bestial train.<br>
His face the semblance of a just man's wore,<br>
So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;<br>
The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws<br>
Reach'd to the armpits, and the back and breast,<br>
And either side, were painted o'er with nodes<br>
And orbits. &nbsp;Colours variegated more<br>
Nor Turks nor Tartars e'er on cloth of state<br>
With interchangeable embroidery wove,<br>
Nor spread Arachne o'er her curious loom.<br>
As ofttimes a light skiff, moor'd to the shore,<br>
Stands part in water, part upon the land;<br>
Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor,<br>
The beaver settles watching for his prey;<br>
So on the rim, that fenc'd the sand with rock,<br>
Sat perch'd the fiend of evil. &nbsp;In the void<br>
Glancing, his tail upturn'd its venomous fork,<br>
With sting like scorpion's arm'd. &nbsp;Then thus my guide:<br>
"Now need our way must turn few steps apart,<br>
Far as to that ill beast, who couches there."<br>
<br>Thereat toward the right our downward course<br>
We shap'd, and, better to escape the flame<br>
And burning marle, ten paces on the verge<br>
Proceeded. &nbsp;Soon as we to him arrive,<br>
A little further on mine eye beholds<br>
A tribe of spirits, seated on the sand<br>
Near the wide chasm. &nbsp;Forthwith my master spake:<br>
"That to the full thy knowledge may extend<br>
Of all this round contains, go now, and mark<br>
The mien these wear: but hold not long discourse.<br>
Till thou returnest, I with him meantime<br>
Will parley, that to us he may vouchsafe<br>
The aid of his strong shoulders." &nbsp;Thus alone<br>
Yet forward on the' extremity I pac'd<br>
Of that seventh circle, where the mournful tribe<br>
Were seated. &nbsp;At the eyes forth gush'd their pangs.<br>
Against the vapours and the torrid soil<br>
Alternately their shifting hands they plied.<br>
Thus use the dogs in summer still to ply<br>
Their jaws and feet by turns, when bitten sore<br>
By gnats, or flies, or gadflies swarming round.<br>
<br>Noting the visages of some, who lay<br>
Beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire,<br>
One of them all I knew not; but perceiv'd,<br>
That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch<br>
With colours and with emblems various mark'd,<br>
On which it seem'd as if their eye did feed.<br>
<br>And when amongst them looking round I came,<br>
A yellow purse I saw with azure wrought,<br>
That wore a lion's countenance and port.<br>
Then still my sight pursuing its career,<br>
Another I beheld, than blood more red.<br>
A goose display of whiter wing than curd.<br>
And one, who bore a fat and azure swine<br>
Pictur'd on his white scrip, addressed me thus:<br>
"What dost thou in this deep? &nbsp;Go now and know,<br>
Since yet thou livest, that my neighbour here<br>
Vitaliano on my left shall sit.<br>
A Paduan with these Florentines am I.<br>
Ofttimes they thunder in mine ears, exclaiming<br>
'O haste that noble knight! he who the pouch<br>
With the three beaks will bring!'" &nbsp;This said, he writh'd<br>
The mouth, and loll'd the tongue out, like an ox<br>
That licks his nostrils. &nbsp;I, lest longer stay<br>
He ill might brook, who bade me stay not long,<br>
Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn'd.<br>
<br>My guide already seated on the haunch<br>
Of the fierce animal I found; and thus<br>
He me encourag'd. &nbsp;"Be thou stout; be bold.<br>
Down such a steep flight must we now descend!<br>
Mount thou before: for that no power the tail<br>
May have to harm thee, I will be i' th' midst."<br>
<br>As one, who hath an ague fit so near,<br>
His nails already are turn'd blue, and he<br>
Quivers all o'er, if he but eye the shade;<br>
Such was my cheer at hearing of his words.<br>
But shame soon interpos'd her threat, who makes<br>
The servant bold in presence of his lord.<br>
<br>I settled me upon those shoulders huge,<br>
And would have said, but that the words to aid<br>
My purpose came not, "Look thou clasp me firm!"<br>
<br>But he whose succour then not first I prov'd,<br>
Soon as I mounted, in his arms aloft,<br>
Embracing, held me up, and thus he spake:<br>
"Geryon! now move thee! be thy wheeling gyres<br>
Of ample circuit, easy thy descent.<br>
Think on th' unusual burden thou sustain'st."<br>
<br>As a small vessel, back'ning out from land,<br>
Her station quits; so thence the monster loos'd,<br>
And when he felt himself at large, turn'd round<br>
There where the breast had been, his forked tail.<br>
Thus, like an eel, outstretch'd at length he steer'd,<br>
Gath'ring the air up with retractile claws.<br>
<br>Not greater was the dread when Phaeton<br>
The reins let drop at random, whence high heaven,<br>
Whereof signs yet appear, was wrapt in flames;<br>
Nor when ill-fated Icarus perceiv'd,<br>
By liquefaction of the scalded wax,<br>
The trusted pennons loosen'd from his loins,<br>
His sire exclaiming loud, "Ill way thou keep'st!"<br>
Than was my dread, when round me on each part<br>
The air I view'd, and other object none<br>
Save the fell beast. &nbsp;He slowly sailing, wheels<br>
His downward motion, unobserv'd of me,<br>
But that the wind, arising to my face,<br>
Breathes on me from below. &nbsp;Now on our right<br>
I heard the cataract beneath us leap<br>
With hideous crash; whence bending down to' explore,<br>
New terror I conceiv'd at the steep plunge:<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/17-171.jpg"><img alt="17-171b.jpg (46K)" src="images/17-171b.jpg" height="529" width="354"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


For flames I saw, and wailings smote mine ear:<br>
So that all trembling close I crouch'd my limbs,<br>
And then distinguish'd, unperceiv'd before,<br>
By the dread torments that on every side<br>
Drew nearer, how our downward course we wound.<br>
<br>As falcon, that hath long been on the wing,<br>
But lure nor bird hath seen, while in despair<br>
The falconer cries, "Ah me! thou stoop'st to earth!"<br>
Wearied descends, and swiftly down the sky<br>
In many an orbit wheels, then lighting sits<br>
At distance from his lord in angry mood;<br>
So Geryon lighting places us on foot<br>
Low down at base of the deep-furrow'd rock,<br>
And, of his burden there discharg'd, forthwith<br>
Sprang forward, like an arrow from the string.</p>
