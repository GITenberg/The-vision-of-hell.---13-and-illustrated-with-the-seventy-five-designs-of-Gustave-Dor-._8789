<h2>CANTO VII</h2>
<br>

<p>"AH me! O Satan! Satan!" loud exclaim'd<br>
Plutus, in accent hoarse of wild alarm:<br>
And the kind sage, whom no event surpris'd,<br>
To comfort me thus spake: "Let not thy fear<br>
Harm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none<br>
To hinder down this rock thy safe descent."<br>
Then to that sworn lip turning, "Peace!" &nbsp;he cried,<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/07-075.jpg"><img alt="07-075b.jpg (52K)" src="images/07-075b.jpg" height="395" width="497"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

"Curs'd wolf! thy fury inward on thyself<br>
Prey, and consume thee! Through the dark profound<br>
Not without cause he passes. &nbsp;So 't is will'd<br>
On high, there where the great Archangel pour'd<br>
Heav'n's vengeance on the first adulterer proud."<br>
<br>As sails full spread and bellying with the wind<br>
Drop suddenly collaps'd, if the mast split;<br>
So to the ground down dropp'd the cruel fiend.<br>
<br>Thus we, descending to the fourth steep ledge,<br>
Gain'd on the dismal shore, that all the woe<br>
Hems in of all the universe. &nbsp;Ah me!<br>
Almighty Justice! in what store thou heap'st<br>
New pains, new troubles, as I here beheld!<br>
Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this?<br>
<br>E'en as a billow, on Charybdis rising,<br>
Against encounter'd billow dashing breaks;<br>
Such is the dance this wretched race must lead,<br>
Whom more than elsewhere numerous here I found,<br>
From one side and the other, with loud voice,<br>
Both roll'd on weights by main forge of their breasts,<br>
Then smote together, and each one forthwith<br>
Roll'd them back voluble, turning again,<br>
Exclaiming these, "Why holdest thou so fast?"<br>
Those answering, "And why castest thou away?"<br>
So still repeating their despiteful song,<br>
They to the opposite point on either hand<br>
Travers'd the horrid circle: then arriv'd,<br>
Both turn'd them round, and through the middle space<br>
Conflicting met again. &nbsp;At sight whereof<br>
I, stung with grief, thus spake: "O say, my guide!<br>
What race is this? &nbsp;Were these, whose heads are shorn,<br>
On our left hand, all sep'rate to the church?"<br>
<br>He straight replied: "In their first life these all<br>
In mind were so distorted, that they made,<br>
According to due measure, of their wealth,<br>
No use. &nbsp;This clearly from their words collect,<br>
Which they howl forth, at each extremity<br>
Arriving of the circle, where their crime<br>
Contrary' in kind disparts them. &nbsp;To the church<br>
Were separate those, that with no hairy cowls<br>
Are crown'd, both Popes and Cardinals, o'er whom<br>
Av'rice dominion absolute maintains."<br>
<br>I then: "Mid such as these some needs must be,<br>
Whom I shall recognize, that with the blot<br>
Of these foul sins were stain'd." &nbsp;He answering thus:<br>
"Vain thought conceiv'st thou. &nbsp;That ignoble life,<br>
Which made them vile before, now makes them dark,<br>
And to all knowledge indiscernible.<br>
Forever they shall meet in this rude shock:<br>
These from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise,<br>
Those with close-shaven locks. &nbsp;That ill they gave,<br>
And ill they kept, hath of the beauteous world<br>
Depriv'd, and set them at this strife, which needs<br>
No labour'd phrase of mine to set if off.<br>
Now may'st thou see, my son! how brief, how vain,<br>
The goods committed into fortune's hands,<br>
For which the human race keep such a coil!<br>
Not all the gold, that is beneath the moon,<br>
Or ever hath been, of these toil-worn souls<br>
Might purchase rest for one." &nbsp;I thus rejoin'd:<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/07-079.jpg"><img alt="07-079b.jpg (54K)" src="images/07-079b.jpg" height="413" width="494"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<br>"My guide! of thee this also would I learn;<br>
This fortune, that thou speak'st of, what it is,<br>
Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world?"<br>
<br>He thus: "O beings blind! what ignorance<br>
Besets you? &nbsp;Now my judgment hear and mark.<br>
He, whose transcendent wisdom passes all,<br>
The heavens creating, gave them ruling powers<br>
To guide them, so that each part shines to each,<br>
Their light in equal distribution pour'd.<br>
By similar appointment he ordain'd<br>
Over the world's bright images to rule.<br>
Superintendence of a guiding hand<br>
And general minister, which at due time<br>
May change the empty vantages of life<br>
From race to race, from one to other's blood,<br>
Beyond prevention of man's wisest care:<br>
Wherefore one nation rises into sway,<br>
Another languishes, e'en as her will<br>
Decrees, from us conceal'd, as in the grass<br>
The serpent train. &nbsp;Against her nought avails<br>
Your utmost wisdom. &nbsp;She with foresight plans,<br>
Judges, and carries on her reign, as theirs<br>
The other powers divine. &nbsp;Her changes know<br>
Nore intermission: by necessity<br>
She is made swift, so frequent come who claim<br>
Succession in her favours. &nbsp;This is she,<br>
So execrated e'en by those, whose debt<br>
To her is rather praise; they wrongfully<br>
With blame requite her, and with evil word;<br>
But she is blessed, and for that recks not:<br>
Amidst the other primal beings glad<br>
Rolls on her sphere, and in her bliss exults.<br>
Now on our way pass we, to heavier woe<br>
Descending: for each star is falling now,<br>
That mounted at our entrance, and forbids<br>
Too long our tarrying." &nbsp;We the circle cross'd<br>
To the next steep, arriving at a well,<br>
That boiling pours itself down to a foss<br>
Sluic'd from its source. &nbsp;Far murkier was the wave<br>
Than sablest grain: and we in company<br>
Of the' inky waters, journeying by their side,<br>
Enter'd, though by a different track, beneath.<br>
Into a lake, the Stygian nam'd, expands<br>
The dismal stream, when it hath reach'd the foot<br>
Of the grey wither'd cliffs. &nbsp;Intent I stood<br>
To gaze, and in the marish sunk descried<br>
A miry tribe, all naked, and with looks<br>
Betok'ning rage. &nbsp;They with their hands alone<br>
Struck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet,<br>
Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/07-083.jpg"><img alt="07-083b.jpg (52K)" src="images/07-083b.jpg" height="407" width="493"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<br>The good instructor spake; "Now seest thou, son!<br>
The souls of those, whom anger overcame.<br>
This too for certain know, that underneath<br>
The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs<br>
Into these bubbles make the surface heave,<br>
As thine eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turn.<br>
Fix'd in the slime they say: 'Sad once were we<br>
In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,<br>
Carrying a foul and lazy mist within:<br>
Now in these murky settlings are we sad.'<br>
Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats.<br>
But word distinct can utter none." &nbsp;Our route<br>
Thus compass'd we, a segment widely stretch'd<br>
Between the dry embankment, and the core<br>
Of the loath'd pool, turning meanwhile our eyes<br>
Downward on those who gulp'd its muddy lees;<br>
Nor stopp'd, till to a tower's low base we came.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="8"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO VIII</h2>
<br>

<p>MY theme pursuing, I relate that ere<br>
We reach'd the lofty turret's base, our eyes<br>
Its height ascended, where two cressets hung<br>
We mark'd, and from afar another light<br>
Return the signal, so remote, that scarce<br>
The eye could catch its beam. &nbsp;I turning round<br>
To the deep source of knowledge, thus inquir'd:<br>
"Say what this means? &nbsp;and what that other light<br>
In answer set? &nbsp;what agency doth this?"<br>
<br>"There on the filthy waters," he replied,<br>
"E'en now what next awaits us mayst thou see,<br>
If the marsh-gender'd fog conceal it not."<br>
<br>Never was arrow from the cord dismiss'd,<br>
That ran its way so nimbly through the air,<br>
As a small bark, that through the waves I spied<br>
Toward us coming, under the sole sway<br>
Of one that ferried it, who cried aloud:<br>
"Art thou arriv'd, fell spirit?"&mdash;"Phlegyas, Phlegyas,<br>
This time thou criest in vain," my lord replied;<br>
"No longer shalt thou have us, but while o'er<br>
The slimy pool we pass." &nbsp;As one who hears<br>
Of some great wrong he hath sustain'd, whereat<br>
Inly he pines; so Phlegyas inly pin'd<br>
In his fierce ire. &nbsp;My guide descending stepp'd<br>
Into the skiff, and bade me enter next<br>
Close at his side; nor till my entrance seem'd<br>
The vessel freighted. &nbsp;Soon as both embark'd,<br>
Cutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow,<br>
More deeply than with others it is wont.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/08-087.jpg"><img alt="08-087b.jpg (50K)" src="images/08-087b.jpg" height="408" width="490"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<br>While we our course o'er the dead channel held.<br>
One drench'd in mire before me came, and said;<br>
"Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?"<br>
<br>I answer'd: "Though I come, I tarry not;<br>
But who art thou, that art become so foul?"<br>
<br>"One, as thou seest, who mourn:" he straight replied.<br>
<br>To which I thus: "In mourning and in woe,<br>
Curs'd spirit! tarry thou. I know thee well,<br>
E'en thus in filth disguis'd." &nbsp;Then stretch'd he forth<br>
Hands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage<br>
Aware, thrusting him back: "Away! down there,<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/08-089.jpg"><img alt="08-089b.jpg (48K)" src="images/08-089b.jpg" height="552" width="356"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

"To the' other dogs!" &nbsp;then, with his arms my neck<br>
Encircling, kiss'd my cheek, and spake: "O soul<br>
Justly disdainful! blest was she in whom<br>
Thou was conceiv'd!  He in the world was one<br>
For arrogance noted; to his memory<br>
No virtue lends its lustre; even so<br>
Here is his shadow furious. &nbsp;There above<br>
How many now hold themselves mighty kings<br>
Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire,<br>
Leaving behind them horrible dispraise!"<br>
<br>I then: "Master! him fain would I behold<br>
Whelm'd in these dregs, before we quit the lake."<br>
<br>He thus: "Or ever to thy view the shore<br>
Be offer'd, satisfied shall be that wish,<br>
Which well deserves completion." &nbsp;Scarce his words<br>
Were ended, when I saw the miry tribes<br>
Set on him with such violence, that yet<br>
For that render I thanks to God and praise<br>
"To Filippo Argenti:" cried they all:<br>
And on himself the moody Florentine<br>
Turn'd his avenging fangs. &nbsp;Him here we left,<br>
Nor speak I of him more. &nbsp;But on mine ear<br>
Sudden a sound of lamentation smote,<br>
Whereat mine eye unbarr'd I sent abroad.<br>
<br>And thus the good instructor: "Now, my son!<br>
Draws near the city, that of Dis is nam'd,<br>
With its grave denizens, a mighty throng."<br>
<br>I thus: "The minarets already, Sir!<br>
There certes in the valley I descry,<br>
Gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire<br>
Had issu'd." &nbsp;He replied: "Eternal fire,<br>
That inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame<br>
Illum'd; as in this nether hell thou seest."<br>
<br>We came within the fosses deep, that moat<br>
This region comfortless. &nbsp;The walls appear'd<br>
As they were fram'd of iron. &nbsp;We had made<br>
Wide circuit, ere a place we reach'd, where loud<br>
The mariner cried vehement: "Go forth!<br>
The' entrance is here!" &nbsp;Upon the gates I spied<br>
More than a thousand, who of old from heaven<br>
Were hurl'd. &nbsp;With ireful gestures, "Who is this,"<br>
They cried, "that without death first felt, goes through<br>
The regions of the dead?" &nbsp;My sapient guide<br>
Made sign that he for secret parley wish'd;<br>
Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus<br>
They spake: "Come thou alone; and let him go<br>
Who hath so hardily enter'd this realm.<br>
Alone return he by his witless way;<br>
If well he know it, let him prove. &nbsp;For thee,<br>
Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark<br>
Hast been his escort." Now bethink thee, reader!<br>
What cheer was mine at sound of those curs'd words.<br>
I did believe I never should return.<br>
<br>"O my lov'd guide! who more than seven times<br>
Security hast render'd me, and drawn<br>
From peril deep, whereto I stood expos'd,<br>
Desert me not," I cried, "in this extreme.<br>
And if our onward going be denied,<br>
Together trace we back our steps with speed."<br>
<br>My liege, who thither had conducted me,<br>
Replied: "Fear not: for of our passage none<br>
Hath power to disappoint us, by such high<br>
Authority permitted. &nbsp;But do thou<br>
Expect me here; meanwhile thy wearied spirit<br>
Comfort, and feed with kindly hope, assur'd<br>
I will not leave thee in this lower world."<br>
<br>This said, departs the sire benevolent,<br>
And quits me. &nbsp;Hesitating I remain<br>
At war 'twixt will and will not in my thoughts.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/08-093.jpg"><img alt="08-093b.jpg (48K)" src="images/08-093b.jpg" height="402" width="490"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<br>I could not hear what terms he offer'd them,<br>
But they conferr'd not long, for all at once<br>
To trial fled within. &nbsp;Clos'd were the gates<br>
By those our adversaries on the breast<br>
Of my liege lord: excluded he return'd<br>
To me with tardy steps. &nbsp;Upon the ground<br>
His eyes were bent, and from his brow eras'd<br>
All confidence, while thus with sighs he spake:<br>
"Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?"<br>
Then thus to me: "That I am anger'd, think<br>
No ground of terror: in this trial I<br>
Shall vanquish, use what arts they may within<br>
For hindrance. &nbsp;This their insolence, not new,<br>
Erewhile at gate less secret they display'd,<br>
Which still is without bolt; upon its arch<br>
Thou saw'st the deadly scroll: and even now<br>
On this side of its entrance, down the steep,<br>
Passing the circles, unescorted, comes<br>
One whose strong might can open us this land."</p>
