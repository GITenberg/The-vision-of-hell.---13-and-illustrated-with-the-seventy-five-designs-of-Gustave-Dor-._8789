<h2>CANTO XXIII</h2>
<br>

<p>IN silence and in solitude we went,<br>
One first, the other following his steps,<br>
As minor friars journeying on their road.<br>
<br>The present fray had turn'd my thoughts to muse<br>
Upon old Aesop's fable, where he told<br>
What fate unto the mouse and frog befell.<br>
For language hath not sounds more like in sense,<br>
Than are these chances, if the origin<br>
And end of each be heedfully compar'd.<br>
And as one thought bursts from another forth,<br>
So afterward from that another sprang,<br>
Which added doubly to my former fear.<br>
For thus I reason'd: "These through us have been<br>
So foil'd, with loss and mock'ry so complete,<br>
As needs must sting them sore. &nbsp;If anger then<br>
Be to their evil will conjoin'd, more fell<br>
They shall pursue us, than the savage hound<br>
Snatches the leveret, panting 'twixt his jaws."<br>
<br>Already I perceiv'd my hair stand all<br>
On end with terror, and look'd eager back.<br>
<br>"Teacher," I thus began, "if speedily<br>
Thyself and me thou hide not, much I dread<br>
Those evil talons. &nbsp;Even now behind<br>
They urge us: quick imagination works<br>
So forcibly, that I already feel them."<br>
<br>He answer'd: "Were I form'd of leaded glass,<br>
I should not sooner draw unto myself<br>
Thy outward image, than I now imprint<br>
That from within. &nbsp;This moment came thy thoughts<br>
Presented before mine, with similar act<br>
And count'nance similar, so that from both<br>
I one design have fram'd. &nbsp;If the right coast<br>
Incline so much, that we may thence descend<br>
Into the other chasm, we shall escape<br>
Secure from this imagined pursuit."<br>
<br>He had not spoke his purpose to the end,<br>
When I from far beheld them with spread wings<br>
Approach to take us. &nbsp;Suddenly my guide<br>
Caught me, ev'n as a mother that from sleep<br>
Is by the noise arous'd, and near her sees<br>
The climbing fires, who snatches up her babe<br>
And flies ne'er pausing, careful more of him<br>
Than of herself, that but a single vest<br>
Clings round her limbs. &nbsp;Down from the jutting beach<br>
Supine he cast him, to that pendent rock,<br>
Which closes on one part the other chasm.<br>
<br>Never ran water with such hurrying pace<br>
Adown the tube to turn a landmill's wheel,<br>
When nearest it approaches to the spokes,<br>
As then along that edge my master ran,<br>
Carrying me in his bosom, as a child,<br>
Not a companion. &nbsp;Scarcely had his feet<br>
Reach'd to the lowest of the bed beneath,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/23-219.jpg"><img alt="23-219b.jpg (43K)" src="images/23-219b.jpg" height="545" width="356"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


When over us the steep they reach'd; but fear<br>
In him was none; for that high Providence,<br>
Which plac'd them ministers of the fifth foss,<br>
Power of departing thence took from them all.<br>
<br>There in the depth we saw a painted tribe,<br>
Who pac'd with tardy steps around, and wept,<br>
Faint in appearance and o'ercome with toil.<br>
Caps had they on, with hoods, that fell low down<br>
Before their eyes, in fashion like to those<br>
Worn by the monks in Cologne. &nbsp;Their outside<br>
Was overlaid with gold, dazzling to view,<br>
But leaden all within, and of such weight,<br>
That Frederick's compar'd to these were straw.<br>
Oh, everlasting wearisome attire!<br>
<br>We yet once more with them together turn'd<br>
To leftward, on their dismal moan intent.<br>
But by the weight oppress'd, so slowly came<br>
The fainting people, that our company<br>
Was chang'd at every movement of the step.<br>
<br>Whence I my guide address'd: "See that thou find<br>
Some spirit, whose name may by his deeds be known,<br>
And to that end look round thee as thou go'st."<br>
<br>Then one, who understood the Tuscan voice,<br>
Cried after us aloud: "Hold in your feet,<br>
Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air.<br>
Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish."<br>
<br>Whereat my leader, turning, me bespake:<br>
"Pause, and then onward at their pace proceed."<br>
<br>I staid, and saw two Spirits in whose look<br>
Impatient eagerness of mind was mark'd<br>
To overtake me; but the load they bare<br>
And narrow path retarded their approach.<br>
<br>Soon as arriv'd, they with an eye askance<br>
Perus'd me, but spake not: then turning each<br>
To other thus conferring said: "This one<br>
Seems, by the action of his throat, alive.<br>
And, be they dead, what privilege allows<br>
They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?"<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/23-223.jpg"><img alt="23-223b.jpg (45K)" src="images/23-223b.jpg" height="413" width="491"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>Then thus to me: "Tuscan, who visitest<br>
The college of the mourning hypocrites,<br>
Disdain not to instruct us who thou art."<br>
<br>"By Arno's pleasant stream," I thus replied,<br>
"In the great city I was bred and grew,<br>
And wear the body I have ever worn.<br>
but who are ye, from whom such mighty grief,<br>
As now I witness, courseth down your cheeks?<br>
What torment breaks forth in this bitter woe?"<br>
"Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue,"<br>
One of them answer'd, "are so leaden gross,<br>
That with their weight they make the balances<br>
To crack beneath them. &nbsp;Joyous friars we were,<br>
Bologna's natives, Catalano I,<br>
He Loderingo nam'd, and by thy land<br>
Together taken, as men used to take<br>
A single and indifferent arbiter,<br>
To reconcile their strifes. &nbsp;How there we sped,<br>
Gardingo's vicinage can best declare."<br>
<br>"O friars!" &nbsp;I began, "your miseries&mdash;"<br>
But there brake off, for one had caught my eye,<br>
Fix'd to a cross with three stakes on the ground:<br>
He, when he saw me, writh'd himself, throughout<br>
Distorted, ruffling with deep sighs his beard.<br>
And Catalano, who thereof was 'ware,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/23-225.jpg"><img alt="23-225b.jpg (46K)" src="images/23-225b.jpg" height="558" width="353"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Thus spake: "That pierced spirit, whom intent<br>
Thou view'st, was he who gave the Pharisees<br>
Counsel, that it were fitting for one man<br>
To suffer for the people. &nbsp;He doth lie<br>
Transverse; nor any passes, but him first<br>
Behoves make feeling trial how each weighs.<br>
In straits like this along the foss are plac'd<br>
The father of his consort, and the rest<br>
Partakers in that council, seed of ill<br>
And sorrow to the Jews." &nbsp;I noted then,<br>
How Virgil gaz'd with wonder upon him,<br>
Thus abjectly extended on the cross<br>
In banishment eternal. &nbsp;To the friar<br>
He next his words address'd: "We pray ye tell,<br>
If so be lawful, whether on our right<br>
Lies any opening in the rock, whereby<br>
We both may issue hence, without constraint<br>
On the dark angels, that compell'd they come<br>
To lead us from this depth." &nbsp;He thus replied:<br>
"Nearer than thou dost hope, there is a rock<br>
From the next circle moving, which o'ersteps<br>
Each vale of horror, save that here his cope<br>
Is shatter'd. &nbsp;By the ruin ye may mount:<br>
For on the side it slants, and most the height<br>
Rises below." &nbsp;With head bent down awhile<br>
My leader stood, then spake: "He warn'd us ill,<br>
Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook."<br>
<br>To whom the friar: "At Bologna erst<br>
I many vices of the devil heard,<br>
Among the rest was said, 'He is a liar,<br>
And the father of lies!'" &nbsp;When he had spoke,<br>
My leader with large strides proceeded on,<br>
Somewhat disturb'd with anger in his look.<br>
<br>I therefore left the spirits heavy laden,<br>
And following, his beloved footsteps mark'd.</p>

<h2>CANTO XXIV</h2>
<br>

<p>IN the year's early nonage, when the sun<br>
Tempers his tresses in Aquarius' urn,<br>
And now towards equal day the nights recede,<br>
When as the rime upon the earth puts on<br>
Her dazzling sister's image, but not long<br>
Her milder sway endures, then riseth up<br>
The village hind, whom fails his wintry store,<br>
And looking out beholds the plain around<br>
All whiten'd, whence impatiently he smites<br>
His thighs, and to his hut returning in,<br>
There paces to and fro, wailing his lot,<br>
As a discomfited and helpless man;<br>
Then comes he forth again, and feels new hope<br>
Spring in his bosom, finding e'en thus soon<br>
The world hath chang'd its count'nance, grasps his crook,<br>
And forth to pasture drives his little flock:<br>
So me my guide dishearten'd when I saw<br>
His troubled forehead, and so speedily<br>
That ill was cur'd; for at the fallen bridge<br>
Arriving, towards me with a look as sweet,<br>
He turn'd him back, as that I first beheld<br>
At the steep mountain's foot. &nbsp;Regarding well<br>
The ruin, and some counsel first maintain'd<br>
With his own thought, he open'd wide his arm<br>
And took me up. &nbsp;As one, who, while he works,<br>
Computes his labour's issue, that he seems<br>
Still to foresee the' effect, so lifting me<br>
Up to the summit of one peak, he fix'd<br>
His eye upon another. &nbsp;"Grapple that,"<br>
Said he, "but first make proof, if it be such<br>
As will sustain thee." &nbsp;For one capp'd with lead<br>
This were no journey. &nbsp;Scarcely he, though light,<br>
And I, though onward push'd from crag to crag,<br>
Could mount. &nbsp;And if the precinct of this coast<br>
Were not less ample than the last, for him<br>
I know not, but my strength had surely fail'd.<br>
But Malebolge all toward the mouth<br>
Inclining of the nethermost abyss,<br>
The site of every valley hence requires,<br>
That one side upward slope, the other fall.<br>
<br>At length the point of our descent we reach'd<br>
From the last flag: soon as to that arriv'd,<br>
So was the breath exhausted from my lungs,<br>
I could no further, but did seat me there.<br>
<br>"Now needs thy best of man;" so spake my guide:<br>
"For not on downy plumes, nor under shade<br>
Of canopy reposing, fame is won,<br>
Without which whosoe'er consumes his days<br>
Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth,<br>
As smoke in air or foam upon the wave.<br>
Thou therefore rise: vanish thy weariness<br>
By the mind's effort, in each struggle form'd<br>
To vanquish, if she suffer not the weight<br>
Of her corporeal frame to crush her down.<br>
A longer ladder yet remains to scale.<br>
From these to have escap'd sufficeth not.<br>
If well thou note me, profit by my words."<br>
<br>I straightway rose, and show'd myself less spent<br>
Than I in truth did feel me. &nbsp;"On," I cried,<br>
"For I am stout and fearless." &nbsp;Up the rock<br>
Our way we held, more rugged than before,<br>
Narrower and steeper far to climb. &nbsp;From talk<br>
I ceas'd not, as we journey'd, so to seem<br>
Least faint; whereat a voice from the other foss<br>
Did issue forth, for utt'rance suited ill.<br>
Though on the arch that crosses there I stood,<br>
What were the words I knew not, but who spake<br>
Seem'd mov'd in anger. &nbsp;Down I stoop'd to look,<br>
But my quick eye might reach not to the depth<br>
For shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I spake:<br>
"To the next circle, Teacher, bend thy steps,<br>
And from the wall dismount we; for as hence<br>
I hear and understand not, so I see<br>
Beneath, and naught discern."&mdash;"I answer not,"<br>
Said he, "but by the deed. &nbsp;To fair request<br>
Silent performance maketh best return."<br>
<br>We from the bridge's head descended, where<br>
To the eighth mound it joins, and then the chasm<br>
Opening to view, I saw a crowd within<br>
Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape<br>
And hideous, that remembrance in my veins<br>
Yet shrinks the vital current. &nbsp;Of her sands<br>
Let Lybia vaunt no more: if Jaculus,<br>
Pareas and Chelyder be her brood,<br>
Cenchris and Amphisboena, plagues so dire<br>
Or in such numbers swarming ne'er she shew'd,<br>
Not with all Ethiopia, and whate'er<br>
Above the Erythraean sea is spawn'd.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/24-233.jpg"><img alt="24-233b.jpg (56K)" src="images/24-233b.jpg" height="417" width="490"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>Amid this dread exuberance of woe<br>
Ran naked spirits wing'd with horrid fear,<br>
Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide,<br>
Or heliotrope to charm them out of view.<br>
With serpents were their hands behind them bound,<br>
Which through their reins infix'd the tail and head<br>
Twisted in folds before. &nbsp;And lo! on one<br>
Near to our side, darted an adder up,<br>
And, where the neck is on the shoulders tied,<br>
Transpierc'd him. &nbsp;Far more quickly than e'er pen<br>
Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn'd, and chang'd<br>
To ashes, all pour'd out upon the earth.<br>
When there dissolv'd he lay, the dust again<br>
Uproll'd spontaneous, and the self-same form<br>
Instant resumed. &nbsp;So mighty sages tell,<br>
The' Arabian Phoenix, when five hundred years<br>
Have well nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith<br>
Renascent. &nbsp;Blade nor herb throughout his life<br>
He tastes, but tears of frankincense alone<br>
And odorous amomum: swaths of nard<br>
And myrrh his funeral shroud. &nbsp;As one that falls,<br>
He knows not how, by force demoniac dragg'd<br>
To earth, or through obstruction fettering up<br>
In chains invisible the powers of man,<br>
Who, risen from his trance, gazeth around,<br>
Bewilder'd with the monstrous agony<br>
He hath endur'd, and wildly staring sighs;<br>
So stood aghast the sinner when he rose.<br>
<br>Oh! how severe God's judgment, that deals out<br>
Such blows in stormy vengeance! &nbsp;Who he was<br>
My teacher next inquir'd, and thus in few<br>
He answer'd: "Vanni Fucci am I call'd,<br>
Not long since rained down from Tuscany<br>
To this dire gullet. &nbsp;Me the beastial life<br>
And not the human pleas'd, mule that I was,<br>
Who in Pistoia found my worthy den."<br>
<br>I then to Virgil: "Bid him stir not hence,<br>
And ask what crime did thrust him hither: once<br>
A man I knew him choleric and bloody."<br>
<br>The sinner heard and feign'd not, but towards me<br>
His mind directing and his face, wherein<br>
Was dismal shame depictur'd, thus he spake:<br>
"It grieves me more to have been caught by thee<br>
In this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than<br>
When I was taken from the other life.<br>
I have no power permitted to deny<br>
What thou inquirest." &nbsp;I am doom'd thus low<br>
To dwell, for that the sacristy by me<br>
Was rifled of its goodly ornaments,<br>
And with the guilt another falsely charged.<br>
But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus,<br>
So as thou e'er shalt 'scape this darksome realm<br>
Open thine ears and hear what I forebode.<br>
Reft of the Neri first Pistoia pines,<br>
Then Florence changeth citizens and laws.<br>
From Valdimagra, drawn by wrathful Mars,<br>
A vapour rises, wrapt in turbid mists,<br>
And sharp and eager driveth on the storm<br>
With arrowy hurtling o'er Piceno's field,<br>
Whence suddenly the cloud shall burst, and strike<br>
Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground.<br>
This have I told, that grief may rend thy heart."</p>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XXV</h2>
<br>

<p>WHEN he had spoke, the sinner rais'd his hands<br>
Pointed in mockery, and cried: "Take them, God!<br>
I level them at thee!" &nbsp;From that day forth<br>
The serpents were my friends; for round his neck<br>
One of then rolling twisted, as it said,<br>
"Be silent, tongue!" &nbsp;Another to his arms<br>
Upgliding, tied them, riveting itself<br>
So close, it took from them the power to move.<br>
<br>Pistoia! Ah Pistoia! why dost doubt<br>
To turn thee into ashes, cumb'ring earth<br>
No longer, since in evil act so far<br>
Thou hast outdone thy seed? &nbsp;I did not mark,<br>
Through all the gloomy circles of the' abyss,<br>
Spirit, that swell'd so proudly 'gainst his God,<br>
Not him, who headlong fell from Thebes. &nbsp;He fled,<br>
Nor utter'd more; and after him there came<br>
A centaur full of fury, shouting, "Where<br>
Where is the caitiff?" &nbsp;On Maremma's marsh<br>
Swarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch<br>
They swarm'd, to where the human face begins.<br>
Behind his head upon the shoulders lay,<br>
With open wings, a dragon breathing fire<br>
On whomsoe'er he met. &nbsp;To me my guide:<br>
"Cacus is this, who underneath the rock<br>
Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood.<br>
He, from his brethren parted, here must tread<br>
A different journey, for his fraudful theft<br>
Of the great herd, that near him stall'd; whence found<br>
His felon deeds their end, beneath the mace<br>
Of stout Alcides, that perchance laid on<br>
A hundred blows, and not the tenth was felt."<br>
<br>While yet he spake, the centaur sped away:<br>
And under us three spirits came, of whom<br>
Nor I nor he was ware, till they exclaim'd;<br>
"Say who are ye?" &nbsp;We then brake off discourse,<br>
Intent on these alone. &nbsp;I knew them not;<br>
But, as it chanceth oft, befell, that one<br>
Had need to name another. &nbsp;"Where," said he,<br>
"Doth Cianfa lurk?" &nbsp;I, for a sign my guide<br>
Should stand attentive, plac'd against my lips<br>
The finger lifted. &nbsp;If, O reader! now<br>
Thou be not apt to credit what I tell,<br>
No marvel; for myself do scarce allow<br>
The witness of mine eyes. &nbsp;But as I looked<br>
Toward them, lo! a serpent with six feet<br>
Springs forth on one, and fastens full upon him:<br>
His midmost grasp'd the belly, a forefoot<br>
Seiz'd on each arm (while deep in either cheek<br>
He flesh'd his fangs); the hinder on the thighs<br>
Were spread, 'twixt which the tail inserted curl'd<br>
Upon the reins behind. &nbsp;Ivy ne'er clasp'd<br>
A dodder'd oak, as round the other's limbs<br>
The hideous monster intertwin'd his own.<br>
Then, as they both had been of burning wax,<br>
Each melted into other, mingling hues,<br>
That which was either now was seen no more.<br>
Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns,<br>
A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,<br>
And the clean white expires. &nbsp;The other two<br>
Look'd on exclaiming: "Ah, how dost thou change,<br>
Agnello! &nbsp;See! &nbsp;Thou art nor double now,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/25-239.jpg"><img alt="25-239b.jpg (52K)" src="images/25-239b.jpg" height="546" width="358"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


"Nor only one." &nbsp;The two heads now became<br>
One, and two figures blended in one form<br>
Appear'd, where both were lost. &nbsp;Of the four lengths<br>
Two arms were made: the belly and the chest<br>
The thighs and legs into such members chang'd,<br>
As never eye hath seen. &nbsp;Of former shape<br>
All trace was vanish'd. &nbsp;Two yet neither seem'd<br>
That image miscreate, and so pass'd on<br>
With tardy steps. &nbsp;As underneath the scourge<br>
Of the fierce dog-star, that lays bare the fields,<br>
Shifting from brake to brake, the lizard seems<br>
A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road,<br>
So toward th' entrails of the other two<br>
Approaching seem'd, an adder all on fire,<br>
As the dark pepper-grain, livid and swart.<br>
In that part, whence our life is nourish'd first,<br>
One he transpierc'd; then down before him fell<br>
Stretch'd out. &nbsp;The pierced spirit look'd on him<br>
But spake not; yea stood motionless and yawn'd,<br>
As if by sleep or fev'rous fit assail'd.<br>
He ey'd the serpent, and the serpent him.<br>
One from the wound, the other from the mouth<br>
Breath'd a thick smoke, whose vap'ry columns join'd.<br>
<br>Lucan in mute attention now may hear,<br>
Nor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus! tell,<br>
Nor shine, Nasidius! &nbsp;Ovid now be mute.<br>
What if in warbling fiction he record<br>
Cadmus and Arethusa, to a snake<br>
Him chang'd, and her into a fountain clear,<br>
I envy not; for never face to face<br>
Two natures thus transmuted did he sing,<br>
Wherein both shapes were ready to assume<br>
The other's substance. &nbsp;They in mutual guise<br>
So answer'd, that the serpent split his train<br>
Divided to a fork, and the pierc'd spirit<br>
Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs<br>
Compacted, that no sign of juncture soon<br>
Was visible: the tail disparted took<br>
The figure which the spirit lost, its skin<br>
Soft'ning, his indurated to a rind.<br>
The shoulders next I mark'd, that ent'ring join'd<br>
The monster's arm-pits, whose two shorter feet<br>
So lengthen'd, as the other's dwindling shrunk.<br>
The feet behind then twisting up became<br>
That part that man conceals, which in the wretch<br>
Was cleft in twain. &nbsp;While both the shadowy smoke<br>
With a new colour veils, and generates<br>
Th' excrescent pile on one, peeling it off<br>
From th' other body, lo! upon his feet<br>
One upright rose, and prone the other fell.<br>
Not yet their glaring and malignant lamps<br>
Were shifted, though each feature chang'd beneath.<br>
Of him who stood erect, the mounting face<br>
Retreated towards the temples, and what there<br>
Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears<br>
From the smooth cheeks, the rest, not backward dragg'd,<br>
Of its excess did shape the nose; and swell'd<br>
Into due size protuberant the lips.<br>
He, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends<br>
His sharpen'd visage, and draws down the ears<br>
Into the head, as doth the slug his horns.<br>
His tongue continuous before and apt<br>
For utt'rance, severs; and the other's fork<br>
Closing unites. &nbsp;That done the smoke was laid.<br>
The soul, transform'd into the brute, glides off,<br>
Hissing along the vale, and after him<br>
The other talking sputters; but soon turn'd<br>
His new-grown shoulders on him, and in few<br>
Thus to another spake: "Along this path<br>
Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!"<br>
<br>So saw I fluctuate in successive change<br>
Th' unsteady ballast of the seventh hold:<br>
And here if aught my tongue have swerv'd, events<br>
So strange may be its warrant. &nbsp;O'er mine eyes<br>
Confusion hung, and on my thoughts amaze.<br>
<br>Yet 'scap'd they not so covertly, but well<br>
I mark'd Sciancato: he alone it was<br>
Of the three first that came, who chang'd not: thou,<br>
The other's fate, Gaville, still dost rue.</p>

<h2>CANTO XXVI</h2>
<br>

<p>FLORENCE exult! for thou so mightily<br>
Hast thriven, that o'er land and sea thy wings<br>
Thou beatest, and thy name spreads over hell!<br>
Among the plund'rers such the three I found<br>
Thy citizens, whence shame to me thy son,<br>
And no proud honour to thyself redounds.<br>
<br>But if our minds, when dreaming near the dawn,<br>
Are of the truth presageful, thou ere long<br>
Shalt feel what Prato, (not to say the rest)<br>
Would fain might come upon thee; and that chance<br>
Were in good time, if it befell thee now.<br>
Would so it were, since it must needs befall!<br>
For as time wears me, I shall grieve the more.<br>
<br>We from the depth departed; and my guide<br>
Remounting scal'd the flinty steps, which late<br>
We downward trac'd, and drew me up the steep.<br>
Pursuing thus our solitary way<br>
Among the crags and splinters of the rock,<br>
Sped not our feet without the help of hands.<br>
<br>Then sorrow seiz'd me, which e'en now revives,<br>
As my thought turns again to what I saw,<br>
And, more than I am wont, I rein and curb<br>
The powers of nature in me, lest they run<br>
Where Virtue guides not; that if aught of good<br>
My gentle star, or something better gave me,<br>
I envy not myself the precious boon.<br>
<br>As in that season, when the sun least veils<br>
His face that lightens all, what time the fly<br>
Gives way to the shrill gnat, the peasant then<br>
Upon some cliff reclin'd, beneath him sees<br>
Fire-flies innumerous spangling o'er the vale,<br>
Vineyard or tilth, where his day-labour lies:<br>
With flames so numberless throughout its space<br>
Shone the eighth chasm, apparent, when the depth<br>
Was to my view expos'd. As he, whose wrongs<br>
The bears aveng'd, at its departure saw<br>
Elijah's chariot, when the steeds erect<br>
Rais'd their steep flight for heav'n; his eyes meanwhile,<br>
Straining pursu'd them, till the flame alone<br>
Upsoaring like a misty speck he kenn'd;<br>
E'en thus along the gulf moves every flame,<br>
A sinner so enfolded close in each,<br>
That none exhibits token of the theft.<br>
<br>Upon the bridge I forward bent to look,<br>
And grasp'd a flinty mass, or else had fall'n,<br>
Though push'd not from the height. &nbsp;The guide, who mark'd<br>
How I did gaze attentive, thus began:<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/26-245.jpg"><img alt="26-245b.jpg (42K)" src="images/26-245b.jpg" height="549" width="354"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


"Within these ardours are the spirits, each<br>
Swath'd in confining fire."&mdash;"Master, thy word,"<br>
I answer'd, "hath assur'd me; yet I deem'd<br>
Already of the truth, already wish'd<br>
To ask thee, who is in yon fire, that comes<br>
So parted at the summit, as it seem'd<br>
Ascending from that funeral pile, where lay<br>
The Theban brothers?" &nbsp;He replied: "Within<br>
Ulysses there and Diomede endure<br>
Their penal tortures, thus to vengeance now<br>
Together hasting, as erewhile to wrath.<br>
These in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore<br>
The ambush of the horse, that open'd wide<br>
A portal for that goodly seed to pass,<br>
Which sow'd imperial Rome; nor less the guile<br>
Lament they, whence of her Achilles 'reft<br>
Deidamia yet in death complains.<br>
And there is rued the stratagem, that Troy<br>
Of her Palladium spoil'd."&mdash;"If they have power<br>
Of utt'rance from within these sparks," said I,<br>
"O master! think my prayer a thousand fold<br>
In repetition urg'd, that thou vouchsafe<br>
To pause, till here the horned flame arrive.<br>
See, how toward it with desire I bend."<br>
<br>He thus: "Thy prayer is worthy of much praise,<br>
And I accept it therefore: but do thou<br>
Thy tongue refrain: to question them be mine,<br>
For I divine thy wish: and they perchance,<br>
For they were Greeks, might shun discourse with thee."<br>
<br>When there the flame had come, where time and place<br>
Seem'd fitting to my guide, he thus began:<br>
"O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire!<br>
If living I of you did merit aught,<br>
Whate'er the measure were of that desert,<br>
When in the world my lofty strain I pour'd,<br>
Move ye not on, till one of you unfold<br>
In what clime death o'ertook him self-destroy'd."<br>
<br>Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn<br>
Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire<br>
That labours with the wind, then to and fro<br>
Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds,<br>
Threw out its voice, and spake: "When I escap'd<br>
From Circe, who beyond a circling year<br>
Had held me near Caieta, by her charms,<br>
Ere thus Aeneas yet had nam'd the shore,<br>
Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence<br>
Of my old father, nor return of love,<br>
That should have crown'd Penelope with joy,<br>
Could overcome in me the zeal I had<br>
T' explore the world, and search the ways of life,<br>
Man's evil and his virtue. &nbsp;Forth I sail'd<br>
Into the deep illimitable main,<br>
With but one bark, and the small faithful band<br>
That yet cleav'd to me. &nbsp;As Iberia far,<br>
Far as Morocco either shore I saw,<br>
And the Sardinian and each isle beside<br>
Which round that ocean bathes. &nbsp;Tardy with age<br>
Were I and my companions, when we came<br>
To the strait pass, where Hercules ordain'd<br>
The bound'ries not to be o'erstepp'd by man.<br>
The walls of Seville to my right I left,<br>
On the' other hand already Ceuta past.<br>
"O brothers!" &nbsp;I began, "who to the west<br>
Through perils without number now have reach'd,<br>
To this the short remaining watch, that yet<br>
Our senses have to wake, refuse not proof<br>
Of the unpeopled world, following the track<br>
Of Phoebus. Call to mind from whence we sprang:<br>
Ye were not form'd to live the life of brutes<br>
But virtue to pursue and knowledge high."<br>
With these few words I sharpen'd for the voyage<br>
The mind of my associates, that I then<br>
Could scarcely have withheld them. &nbsp;To the dawn<br>
Our poop we turn'd, and for the witless flight<br>
Made our oars wings, still gaining on the left.<br>
Each star of the' other pole night now beheld,<br>
And ours so low, that from the ocean-floor<br>
It rose not. &nbsp;Five times re-illum'd, as oft<br>
Vanish'd the light from underneath the moon<br>
Since the deep way we enter'd, when from far<br>
Appear'd a mountain dim, loftiest methought<br>
Of all I e'er beheld. &nbsp;Joy seiz'd us straight,<br>
But soon to mourning changed. &nbsp;From the new land<br>
A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side<br>
Did strike the vessel. &nbsp;Thrice it whirl'd her round<br>
With all the waves, the fourth time lifted up<br>
The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed:<br>
And over us the booming billow clos'd."</p>

<h2>CANTO XVII</h2>
<br>

<p>NOW upward rose the flame, and still'd its light<br>
To speak no more, and now pass'd on with leave<br>
From the mild poet gain'd, when following came<br>
Another, from whose top a sound confus'd,<br>
Forth issuing, drew our eyes that way to look.<br>
<br>As the Sicilian bull, that rightfully<br>
His cries first echoed, who had shap'd its mould,<br>
Did so rebellow, with the voice of him<br>
Tormented, that the brazen monster seem'd<br>
Pierc'd through with pain; thus while no way they found<br>
Nor avenue immediate through the flame,<br>
Into its language turn'd the dismal words:<br>
But soon as they had won their passage forth,<br>
Up from the point, which vibrating obey'd<br>
Their motion at the tongue, these sounds we heard:<br>
"O thou! to whom I now direct my voice!<br>
That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase,<br>
<br>'Depart thou, I solicit thee no more,'<br>
Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive<br>
Let it not irk thee here to pause awhile,<br>
And with me parley: lo! it irks not me<br>
And yet I burn. &nbsp;If but e'en now thou fall<br>
into this blind world, from that pleasant land<br>
Of Latium, whence I draw my sum of guilt,<br>
Tell me if those, who in Romagna dwell,<br>
Have peace or war. &nbsp;For of the mountains there<br>
Was I, betwixt Urbino and the height,<br>
Whence Tyber first unlocks his mighty flood."<br>
<br>Leaning I listen'd yet with heedful ear,<br>
When, as he touch'd my side, the leader thus:<br>
"Speak thou: he is a Latian." &nbsp;My reply<br>
Was ready, and I spake without delay:<br>
<br>"O spirit! who art hidden here below!<br>
Never was thy Romagna without war<br>
In her proud tyrants' bosoms, nor is now:<br>
But open war there left I none. &nbsp;The state,<br>
Ravenna hath maintain'd this many a year,<br>
Is steadfast. &nbsp;There Polenta's eagle broods,<br>
And in his broad circumference of plume<br>
O'ershadows Cervia. The green talons grasp<br>
The land, that stood erewhile the proof so long,<br>
And pil'd in bloody heap the host of France.<br>
<br>"The' old mastiff of Verruchio and the young,<br>
That tore Montagna in their wrath, still make,<br>
Where they are wont, an augre of their fangs.<br>
<br>"Lamone's city and Santerno's range<br>
Under the lion of the snowy lair.<br>
Inconstant partisan! that changeth sides,<br>
Or ever summer yields to winter's frost.<br>
And she, whose flank is wash'd of Savio's wave,<br>
As 'twixt the level and the steep she lies,<br>
Lives so 'twixt tyrant power and liberty.<br>
<br>"Now tell us, I entreat thee, who art thou?<br>
Be not more hard than others. &nbsp;In the world,<br>
So may thy name still rear its forehead high."<br>
<br>Then roar'd awhile the fire, its sharpen'd point<br>
On either side wav'd, and thus breath'd at last:<br>
"If I did think, my answer were to one,<br>
Who ever could return unto the world,<br>
This flame should rest unshaken. &nbsp;But since ne'er,<br>
If true be told me, any from this depth<br>
Has found his upward way, I answer thee,<br>
Nor fear lest infamy record the words.<br>
<br>"A man of arms at first, I cloth'd me then<br>
In good Saint Francis' girdle, hoping so<br>
T' have made amends. &nbsp;And certainly my hope<br>
Had fail'd not, but that he, whom curses light on,<br>
The' high priest again seduc'd me into sin.<br>
And how and wherefore listen while I tell.<br>
Long as this spirit mov'd the bones and pulp<br>
My mother gave me, less my deeds bespake<br>
The nature of the lion than the fox.<br>
All ways of winding subtlety I knew,<br>
And with such art conducted, that the sound<br>
Reach'd the world's limit. &nbsp;Soon as to that part<br>
Of life I found me come, when each behoves<br>
To lower sails and gather in the lines;<br>
That which before had pleased me then I rued,<br>
And to repentance and confession turn'd;<br>
Wretch that I was! and well it had bested me!<br>
The chief of the new Pharisees meantime,<br>
Waging his warfare near the Lateran,<br>
Not with the Saracens or Jews (his foes<br>
All Christians were, nor against Acre one<br>
Had fought, nor traffic'd in the Soldan's land),<br>
He his great charge nor sacred ministry<br>
In himself, rev'renc'd, nor in me that cord,<br>
Which us'd to mark with leanness whom it girded.<br>
As in Socrate, Constantine besought<br>
To cure his leprosy Sylvester's aid,<br>
So me to cure the fever of his pride<br>
This man besought: my counsel to that end<br>
He ask'd: and I was silent: for his words<br>
Seem'd drunken: but forthwith he thus resum'd:<br>
"From thy heart banish fear: of all offence<br>
I hitherto absolve thee. &nbsp;In return,<br>
Teach me my purpose so to execute,<br>
That Penestrino cumber earth no more.<br>
Heav'n, as thou knowest, I have power to shut<br>
And open: and the keys are therefore twain,<br>
The which my predecessor meanly priz'd."<br>
<br>Then, yielding to the forceful arguments,<br>
Of silence as more perilous I deem'd,<br>
And answer'd: "Father! since thou washest me<br>
Clear of that guilt wherein I now must fall,<br>
Large promise with performance scant, be sure,<br>
Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat."<br>
<br>"When I was number'd with the dead, then came<br>
Saint Francis for me; but a cherub dark<br>
He met, who cried: "'Wrong me not; he is mine,<br>
And must below to join the wretched crew,<br>
For the deceitful counsel which he gave.<br>
E'er since I watch'd him, hov'ring at his hair,<br>
No power can the impenitent absolve;<br>
Nor to repent and will at once consist,<br>
By contradiction absolute forbid."<br>
Oh mis'ry! how I shook myself, when he<br>
Seiz'd me, and cried, "Thou haply thought'st me not<br>
A disputant in logic so exact."<br>
To Minos down he bore me, and the judge<br>
Twin'd eight times round his callous back the tail,<br>
Which biting with excess of rage, he spake:<br>
'This is a guilty soul, that in the fire<br>
Must vanish.' &nbsp;Hence perdition-doom'd I rove<br>
A prey to rankling sorrow in this garb."<br>
<br>When he had thus fulfill'd his words, the flame<br>
In dolour parted, beating to and fro,<br>
And writhing its sharp horn. &nbsp;We onward went,<br>
I and my leader, up along the rock,<br>
Far as another arch, that overhangs<br>
The foss, wherein the penalty is paid<br>
Of those, who load them with committed sin.</p>

<h2>CANTO XXVIII</h2>
<br>

<p>WHO, e'en in words unfetter'd, might at full<br>
Tell of the wounds and blood that now I saw,<br>
Though he repeated oft the tale? No tongue<br>
So vast a theme could equal, speech and thought<br>
Both impotent alike. &nbsp;If in one band<br>
Collected, stood the people all, who e'er<br>
Pour'd on Apulia's happy soil their blood,<br>
Slain by the Trojans, and in that long war<br>
When of the rings the measur'd booty made<br>
A pile so high, as Rome's historian writes<br>
Who errs not, with the multitude, that felt<br>
The grinding force of Guiscard's Norman steel,<br>
And those the rest, whose bones are gather'd yet<br>
At Ceperano, there where treachery<br>
Branded th' Apulian name, or where beyond<br>
Thy walls, O Tagliacozzo, without arms<br>
The old Alardo conquer'd; and his limbs<br>
One were to show transpierc'd, another his<br>
Clean lopt away; a spectacle like this<br>
Were but a thing of nought, to the' hideous sight<br>
Of the ninth chasm. &nbsp;A rundlet, that hath lost<br>
Its middle or side stave, gapes not so wide,<br>
As one I mark'd, torn from the chin throughout<br>
Down to the hinder passage: 'twixt the legs<br>
Dangling his entrails hung, the midriff lay<br>
Open to view, and wretched ventricle,<br>
That turns th' englutted aliment to dross.<br>
<br>Whilst eagerly I fix on him my gaze,<br>
He ey'd me, with his hands laid his breast bare,<br>
And cried; "Now mark how I do rip me! lo!<br>

"How is Mohammed mangled! before me<br>
Walks Ali weeping, from the chin his face<br>
Cleft to the forelock; and the others all<br>
Whom here thou seest, while they liv'd, did sow<br>
Scandal and schism, and therefore thus are rent.<br>
A fiend is here behind, who with his sword<br>
Hacks us thus cruelly, slivering again<br>
Each of this ream, when we have compast round<br>
The dismal way, for first our gashes close<br>
Ere we repass before him. &nbsp;But say who<br>
Art thou, that standest musing on the rock,<br>
Haply so lingering to delay the pain<br>
Sentenc'd upon thy crimes?"&mdash;"Him death not yet,"<br>
My guide rejoin'd, "hath overta'en, nor sin<br>
Conducts to torment; but, that he may make<br>
Full trial of your state, I who am dead<br>
Must through the depths of hell, from orb to orb,<br>
Conduct him. &nbsp;Trust my words, for they are true."<br>
<br>More than a hundred spirits, when that they heard,<br>
Stood in the foss to mark me, through amazed,<br>
Forgetful of their pangs. &nbsp;"Thou, who perchance<br>
Shalt shortly view the sun, this warning thou<br>
Bear to Dolcino: bid him, if he wish not<br>
Here soon to follow me, that with good store<br>
Of food he arm him, lest impris'ning snows<br>
Yield him a victim to Novara's power,<br>
No easy conquest else." &nbsp;With foot uprais'd<br>
For stepping, spake Mohammed, on the ground<br>
Then fix'd it to depart. &nbsp;Another shade,<br>
Pierc'd in the throat, his nostrils mutilate<br>
E'en from beneath the eyebrows, and one ear<br>
Lopt off, who with the rest through wonder stood<br>
Gazing, before the rest advanc'd, and bar'd<br>
His wind-pipe, that without was all o'ersmear'd<br>
With crimson stain. &nbsp;"O thou!" said 'he, "whom sin<br>
Condemns not, and whom erst (unless too near<br>
Resemblance do deceive me) I aloft<br>
Have seen on Latian ground, call thou to mind<br>

"And there instruct the twain, whom Fano boasts<br>
Her worthiest sons, Guido and Angelo,<br>
That if 't is giv'n us here to scan aright<br>
The future, they out of life's tenement<br>
Shall be cast forth, and whelm'd under the waves<br>
Near to Cattolica, through perfidy<br>
Of a fell tyrant. &nbsp;'Twixt the Cyprian isle<br>
And Balearic, ne'er hath Neptune seen<br>
An injury so foul, by pirates done<br>
Or Argive crew of old. &nbsp;That one-ey'd traitor<br>
(Whose realm there is a spirit here were fain<br>
His eye had still lack'd sight of) them shall bring<br>
To conf'rence with him, then so shape his end,<br>
That they shall need not 'gainst Focara's wind<br>
Offer up vow nor pray'r." &nbsp;I answering thus:<br>
<br>"Declare, as thou dost wish that I above<br>
May carry tidings of thee, who is he,<br>
In whom that sight doth wake such sad remembrance?"<br>
<br>Forthwith he laid his hand on the cheek-bone<br>
Of one, his fellow-spirit, and his jaws<br>
Expanding, cried: "Lo! this is he I wot of;<br>
He speaks not for himself: the outcast this<br>
Who overwhelm'd the doubt in Caesar's mind,<br>
Affirming that delay to men prepar'd<br>
Was ever harmful. &nbsp;"Oh &nbsp;how terrified<br>
Methought was Curio, from whose throat was cut<br>
The tongue, which spake that hardy word. &nbsp;Then one<br>
Maim'd of each hand, uplifted in the gloom<br>
The bleeding stumps, that they with gory spots<br>
Sullied his face, and cried: 'Remember thee<br>
Of Mosca, too, I who, alas! exclaim'd,<br>
"The deed once done there is an end," that prov'd<br>
A seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race."<br>
<br>I added: "Ay, and death to thine own tribe."<br>
<br>Whence heaping woe on woe he hurried off,<br>
As one grief stung to madness. &nbsp;But I there<br>
Still linger'd to behold the troop, and saw<br>
Things, such as I may fear without more proof<br>
To tell of, but that conscience makes me firm,<br>
The boon companion, who her strong breast-plate<br>
Buckles on him, that feels no guilt within<br>
And bids him on and fear not. &nbsp;Without doubt<br>
I saw, and yet it seems to pass before me,<br>
A headless trunk, that even as the rest<br>
Of the sad flock pac'd onward. &nbsp;By the hair<br>
It bore the sever'd member, lantern-wise<br>
Pendent in hand, which look'd at us and said,<br>

"Woe's me!" &nbsp;The spirit lighted thus himself,<br>
And two there were in one, and one in two.<br>
How that may be he knows who ordereth so.<br>
<br>When at the bridge's foot direct he stood,<br>
His arm aloft he rear'd, thrusting the head<br>
Full in our view, that nearer we might hear<br>
The words, which thus it utter'd: "Now behold<br>
This grievous torment, thou, who breathing go'st<br>
To spy the dead; behold if any else<br>
Be terrible as this. &nbsp;And that on earth<br>
Thou mayst bear tidings of me, know that I<br>
Am Bertrand, he of Born, who gave King John<br>
The counsel mischievous. &nbsp;Father and son<br>
I set at mutual war. &nbsp;For Absalom<br>
And David more did not Ahitophel,<br>
Spurring them on maliciously to strife.<br>
For parting those so closely knit, my brain<br>
Parted, alas! I carry from its source,<br>
That in this trunk inhabits. &nbsp;Thus the law<br>
Of retribution fiercely works in me."</p>
